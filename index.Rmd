# Syllabus

These course notes include information and study materials on the quantitative part of MS.0825 Research methods course of [Agri-Food Business Management](https://www.emu.ee/en/admissions/agri-food-business-management/) Master's program. 

## Teaching

Flipped classroom approach is used for teaching. This means that students are expected to learn the methods before meetings. During the meetings we revise the theoretical material, address any questions and apply methods in practice. After meetings students apply the methods on their own datasets.

### Schedule

Meetings take place on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays at 9 o'clock in the morning. Link to meetings is provided under the course page in [Moodle](https://moodle.edu.ee).

### Aims

After completing the course students should be able to ...

... understand basic concepts in statistics;  
... know how to describe data, both numerically and visually;   
... choose an appropriate method to solve a problem;  
... use a statistical package for data analysis;  
... communicate results (interpret, explain, present);  
... learn about statistical methods individually;   
... find the courage to apply statistical methods.

## Scoring

This part of the course gives 50% of total course points. This 50% consists of 50 points that can be obtained by submitting:

- feedback on reading material for upcoming meeting (`10*1=10` points), and
- report containing the application of methods learned  (`10*4=40` points).

To gain the 40 points students are required to combine the applications of a method into a report. Participation in meetings does not affect points but meetings are not recorded.

### Feedback on reading material

Submit your questions or thoughts on given reading material before each meeting in [Moodle](https://moodle.edu.ee). Feedback can be either 

- an explanation of something you learned, 
- a question on something you don't understand, or
- an answer to another student's question.

Compulsory reading is from two books: @navarro_learning_2018 and @crawley_r_2013.

Each part of feedback is graded as follows:

- 0 points - Feedback is missing or lacking
- 1 point - Feedback demonstrates that student has revised relevant material

### Research project

Students are required to create a research report as follows:

1. Choose a data set
2. Apply at least one method from each meeting on this data set
3. Make changes according to feedback
4. Present the results as a written report

Submit the report before the end of May. 

Each method is graded as follows:

- 2 points
- 4 points

#### Datasets

To apply methods, datasets need to have multiple variables. We mostly learn to explore continuous data but some methods require at least one discrete variable. Students are free to choose a dataset with the requriment that chosen data  is different from what other students have chosen. Possible sources for data:

- [Goodle dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)
- [Kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- [Data hub collections](https://datahub.io/collections)
