# Syllabus

These cours
e notes include information and study materials on the quantitative part of MS.0825 Research methods course of [Agri-Food Business Management](https://www.emu.ee/en/admissions/agri-food-business-management/) Master's program.

<!--
## Teaching

Flipped classroom approach is used for teaching. This means that students are expected to learn the methods before meetings. During the meetings we revise the theoretical material, address any questions and apply methods in practice. In order to discuss the topics during meetings it is necessary that students are already acquainted to the reading material. After meetings students apply the methods on their own datasets.

### Schedule

See meeting times on [Moode](https://moodle.edu.ee/) under course MS.0825 Research methods.

### Aims

After completing the course students should be able to:

- understand basic concepts in statistics;  
- know how to describe data, both numerically and visually;   
- choose an appropriate method to solve a problem;  
- use a statistical package for data analysis;  
- communicate the results of an analysis (interpret, explain, present);  
- learn about statistical methods individually;   
- find the courage to apply statistical methods.

## Scoring

This part of the course gives 50% of total course points. This 50% consists of 50 points that can be obtained by submitting:

- answers to tests on the methods based on reading material ($10 \times 2 = 20$ points), and
- a report containing the application of methods learned  ($10 \times 3 = 30$ points).

Thus, students are required to acquaint themselves with the reading material to understand the theory behind the methods and also to demonstrate the ability to apply the methods in practice.

### Tests on reading material

From the third meeting onwards, students will complete a test during the beginning of each meeting to demonstrate their understanding of the reading material. Compulsory reading is from the following books: @navarro_learning_2018, @crawley_r_2013 and @hastie_elements_2017.

Tests consist of four questions, each contributing half of a point towards the final score.

### Research project

Students are required to create a research report as follows:

1. Choose at least one data set
2. Apply at least one method from 10 topics on this data set (i.e. you can skip 2 topics)
3. Make changes according to feedback
4. Present the results as a written report

In case of each topic, one point is assigned for each of the following: method is suitable for the data, method is correctly applied, interpretation of the results is correct.

#### Datasets

To apply methods, datasets need to have multiple variables. We mostly learn to explore continuous data but some methods require at least one discrete variable. Students are free to choose a dataset. Possible sources for data:

- Jamovi: `Open > Data Library`
- [Goodle dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)
- [Kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- [Data hub collections](https://datahub.io/collections)
- [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/)
- [World Values Survey](https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/)
- [European Social Survey](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/data/)

## Meetings and topics

We have a total of 12 meetings that involve the topics as outlined below. We will cover some common statistical methods.

1. Introduction. Descriptive statistics
2. Hypothesis testing. Comparing categorical variables
3. Comparing numerical variables
4. Analysis of variance
5. Correlation analysis
6. Simple linear regression
7. Data transformations
8. Multiple linear regression
9. Logistic regression
10. Principal component analysis
11. Factor analysis
12. Clustering

Note that two topics are covered during the first meetings.
