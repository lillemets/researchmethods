	abstract = {Demographic trends do not give much hope for rural regions in developed economies. Many studies prescribe rural futures as manifestations of consumption of the countryside by an urban majority. However, many of these macro-images and typologies lack explicit micro-agency. This article illustrates what are the expectations from personal futures in rural areas, where speciﬁcally and by whom. The respondents of a national survey represented the Finnish youth, who described their dream future in 2030 in terms of livelihood, accommodation and lifestyle recipe. Analysis of the dreams resulted in distinct regional proﬁles. Urban-adjacent rural areas are proﬁled as places for a cosy life with spacious housing, home-based activities, nature, privacy and commuting. Rural centres (villages and parishes) had a comparative advantage in small-scale life. The advantage is related to beneﬁts of smallness and economies of proximity: communality, safety and societal involvement. Self-made life attracted the youth to remote rural areas along with opportunities for entrepreneurship, pluriactivity and naturerelated activities. Those of rural origin and a higher age increased the probability of rural destinations in the dreams. The effectiveness of rural, regional and municipal development policy could potentially beneﬁt signiﬁcantly by providing direct responses to the dreams of the youth, based on the research contributions which proﬁle regions for the future at this level of abstraction.},

	abstract = {Based on a graphical analysis, we investigate the impacts of the Fischler Reform of the Common Agricultural Policy on land rental prices and the capitalization of single farm payments (SFP) into land values. The model shows that the degree of capitalization mainly depends on the scarcity/surplus of SFP entitlements relative to eligible hectares, the implementation model (historical versus regional) and the land supply elasticity. If there are more SFP entitlements than eligible hectares, the degree of capitalization into land values may not decline and may even increase due to the inclusion of other supports such as animal premiums in the SFP. We test this hypothesis with an empirical analysis of cross-section data on land rental prices in Bavaria for 2005. Empirical results indicate that decoupled SFP are capitalized into rental prices to a larger degree than the coupled direct payments of the time prior to the reform.},

These issues concern some of the most fundamental advantages and disadvantages of each basic research design. Problems include improper use of hypothesis tests for covariate balance between the treated and control groups, and the consequences of using randomization, blocking before randomization and matching after assignment of treatment to achieve covariate balance. Applied researchers in a wide range of scientiﬁc disciplines seem to fall prey to one or more of these fallacies and as a result make suboptimal design or analysis choices. To clarify these points, we derive a new four-part decomposition of the key estimation errors in making causal inferences. We then show how this decomposition can help scholars from different experimental and observational research traditions to understand better each other’s inferential problems and attempted solutions.},

	abstract = {Twenty years has passed since Finland joined the European Union in 1995. Agriculture was one of the key areas in which signiﬁcant changes were both anticipated and realised. Besides the European-wide structural change towards larger production units and the steeply decreasing number of farms, the EU's agricultural policy has brought about signiﬁcant changes in farming as a livelihood and the ways in which it is practiced in Finland. These changes involve environmental considerations related to fertilisation or tillage practices, for example, but they are also reﬂected in wider meaning-making related to what farming fundamentally is about. Using the concept of good farming as the key, we explore how the introduced agri-environmental policies have changed farming practices and how this is reﬂected in the ways that good farming ideals are understood and constituted among different farmers. The analysis is based on interviews in which farmers describe their farming practices, purposes and the inﬂuence of policies. Our results suggest that the ideals related to good farming are diversifying and changing as the ways of gaining a livelihood through farming changes. This change occurs as the ideals are renegotiated when performing new voluntary or forced practices. Good farming ideals do not only function as a cultural barrier to the adoption of new practices, but they can actively contribute to the accommodation and development of the practices.},

This paper analyzes the factors that drive rural households and individuals in their income-source diversiﬁcation choices in a Northern China township. At the household level, we distinguish three types of diversiﬁcation as opposed to grain production only: within-farm (non-grain production) activities, local off-farm activities, and migration. We ﬁnd that land availability stimulates on-farm diversiﬁcation. Local off-farm activities are mostly driven by households' asset positions and working resources, while migration decisions strongly depend on the household size and composition. At the individual level, we analyze the determinants of participation in three different types of jobs as compared to agricultural work: local off-farm employment, local self-employment and migration. We ﬁnd a clear gender and age bias in access to off-farm activities that are mostly undertaken by male and by young people. The households' asset positions as well as village networks are found to strongly affect participation in off-farm activities.},

	abstract = {The eﬀorts of the European Commission to reduce regional inequalities over its territory continue to attract the attention of researchers. The purpose of this paper is to perform an exploratory investigation of the relationship between the spatial distribution of regional income and of regional development funds among 145 European regions over 1989–1999. Using a set of tools of spatial statistics, we ﬁrst detect the presence of global and local spatial autocorrelation in the distribution of regional per capita incomes, traducing that rich (poor) regions tend to be clustered close to other rich (poor) regions, and in the distribution of regional growth rate and regional funds. Second, the results of LISA statistics conclude to the presence of spatial heterogeneity in the form of two spatial clusters of rich and poor regions over the decade, highlighting the persistence of a signiﬁcant core-periphery pattern among European regions. Finally, an exploratory analysis reveals a negative correlation between growth and initial income, that tends to indicate b-convergence. A positive relationship between regional growth and structural funds is identiﬁed among the signiﬁcant results as well. Only Andalucia, Galicia and Sterea Ellada show atypical linkages. These results suggest that further research should include spatial eﬀects and the distribution of regional funds in the spatial econometric estimation of regional convergence in Europe.},

The study is based on accounting data from the farms of intensive agriculture in Wielkopolska Province, collected by the Institute of Agricultural and Food Economics in Warsaw in 2004-2009. It was demonstrated that diversified farms achieve similar economic efficiency indicators as specialized farms. At the same time it was proven that the farms with production specializing in breeding cattle, implement their function of “guardians of the countryside” in the same degree or even better. Thus, the main hypothesis of the study formulated on the basis of studying literature was rejected. It said that: specialized farms achieve higher economic efficiency with lower environmental sustainability of the production than diversified farms. In the diversified farms there is higher environmental sustainability of production at lower economic efficiency than in specialized farms.},

This article attempts to ﬁll the void by surveying and evaluating the situation in the Member States of the European Union (EU) and some other countries. Farmers are often exempted from VAT for administrative and political reasons. But this means that the VAT on their inputs cannot be ‘washed out’ through the tax deduction/credit mechanism. It then has to be borne by the farmers themselves or becomes an indeterminate and capricious element in consumer prices. To compensate farmers for the uncompensated VAT on inputs, the EU has devised a ﬂat-rate scheme that permits them to charge a presumptive rate (approximately equal to the effective VAT rate on sector-wide inputs) on their sales to taxable agro-processing ﬁrms which, in turn, are permitted to take a deduction for this ﬂat-rate addition from the VAT on their sales. Obviously, the ﬂat-rate scheme is an arbitrary way of trying to achieve equal treatment between exempt and taxable farmers and between exempt farm products and other taxable goods and services. Full taxation, subject to the general threshold, appears to be the preferred choice.},

The concept of frames refers to relatively distinct and coherent sets of meaning attributed to a concept, such as food security. The article shows that in the European Union (EU) food security is a consensus frame which can be broken down in six conﬂicting and overlapping sub-frames and which has complicated the debates about the future of the CAP. We demonstrate that during the CAP-reform debates of 2009–2012 a variety of food security arguments were deployed by a broad range of stakeholders, who attached different meanings and made different claims about the relationship between the CAP and food security. Inductive frame analysis reveals that the consensus frame of food security can be broken down into six conﬂicting and overlapping sub-frames: (1) the productionist frame, (2) the environmental frame, (3) the development frame, (4) the free trade frame, (5) the regional frame, and (6) the food sovereignty frame. Each of these frames was invoked by a speciﬁc group of stakeholders, whereby the productionist and environmental frames were deployed most often. The European Commission, meanwhile, invoked various frames at the same time in its communications. As a result of these various framings of the relationship between the CAP and food security, a clear political vision on this relationship is lacking. We conclude that politicians and policymakers may need to develop a coherent vision on what food security entails, and on how the CAP could contribute to both European and global food security.},

	abstract = {Recent European research projects have developed approaches that downscale land use related results of economic models. These results are primarily downscaled from the national or regional scale to a spatial resolution appropriate for environmental impact analysis. Different studies represent the interactions between the economic and geographic components of the land system in different ways. This paper explores how interactions between economic and geographic aspects of the land system can be strengthened in modelling studies. It does so by comparing two existing approaches (CLUE and Capri-Spat) for the European Union (EU27). CLUE focuses on disaggregating national level changes in claims for agricultural and urban area to a 1 km × 1 km grid, explicitly addressing consequences of changing demands for agricultural and urban area for other land uses such as (semi-) natural vegetation. Whereas, CAPRI-Spat is concerned with agricultural land use, disaggregating cropping shares, animal stocking densities, yield and agricultural input use for mapping units. The mapping units are clusters of 1 km × 1 km pixels considered homogenous in terms of soil, slope, land cover and administrative region. This paper discusses differences between the two models relating to geographical units, distribution algorithm and most importantly diverging interpretation of ‘agricultural land’, in relationship to their respective concepts and objectives. It concludes that a stronger integration of the geographic and economic aspects can be achieved by linking the overall land use dynamics simulated by CLUE to the detailed representation of the agricultural sector by CAPRI-Spat. Therefore, relative changes in land use classes at 1 km × 1 km resolution obtained from CLUE simulations update a priori means in CAPRI-Spat entering a Highest Posterior Density Estimator. The ﬁndings of this study contribute to our overall capacity to integrate approaches from different disciplines in the integrated analysis of land change and the ex ante assessment of environmental and economic effects of agricultural policies.},

As hosts offering local food, stories, and various activities, they mediate a strong farm identity. The article also explores how farm identities change through three processes by which the ‘new’ work of tourism destabilizes identities. One is a shift in the meaning of farmer identity. Another is the gradual change towards a new master identity, and thirdly there is a multiplicity of identities that shift as they relate to various social memberships and settings.},

It is empirically investigated how policy funds redistribute their effects among regions with different levels of rurality and economic development according to their degree and form of integration. This analysis is performed by constructing and applying a multiregional Input–Output model at a very high level of geographical disaggregation (NUTS 3 level). Alternative allocation of funds across regions (policy scenarios) are considered in order to assess redistributive impacts of possible CAP reforms. Results show that the impacts generated by the CAP across space do not only depend on the initial allocation of funds but also on intersectoral and interregional linkages. This evidence implies that even a radical reallocation of funds, though it may contribute to reducing regional imbalances, is less redistributive than expected.},

Although previous research has shown that this counterurbanisation model is insufﬁcient to explain rural immigration in sparsely populated countries, this paper shows that also within core regions, more diverse conceptualisations of migration into rural areas are required. This is achieved by distinguishing popular, average, and less-popular rural living areas in the northern Netherlands, on the basis of average house prices, and by analysing the migration ﬂows to these areas. Data from Housing Research of the Netherlands demonstrate that popular rural areas attract more highly educated people and people moving from urban areas compared with less-popular and average rural areas. For movers to less-popular areas, being near to family and friends is more important. The characteristics of the movers to popular rural areas ﬁt very well with the counterurbanisation story. Less-popular rural areas in the Netherlands share personal reasons as an important motivation for in-migration with more remote rural areas in Europe. This indicates that conceptualisations of periphery and remoteness have to be considered within the local, regional, and national context.},

We ﬁnd that, overall, EU transfers enable faster growth in the recipient regions as intended, but we estimate that in 36\% of the recipient regions the transfer intensity exceeds the aggregate efﬁciency maximizing level and in 18\% of the regions a reduction of transfers would not even reduce their growth. We conclude that some reallocation of the funds across target regions would lead to higher aggregate growth in the EU and could generate even faster convergence than the current scheme does.},

	abstract = {State agencies have been encouraging the development of different enterprises to diversify farm incomes in an effort to retain farmers in business, attract new entrants to agriculture and promote regional development. Entrepreneurship and farming are known to be driven by a complex set of goals including those which are economic and intrinsic in nature. However, little information is available regarding the set of goals that drive agriculture entrepreneurship, preventing state agencies to adequately target potential diversiﬁers. This paper provides a better understanding of the range of goals, both ﬁnancial and nonﬁnancial, that are important in farmers’ decisions to diversify their operations. The generation of additional income, the continuance of farming and ranching, and the enhancement of quality of life are among the most important diversiﬁcation goals in Texas. A principal component factor analysis performed on the importance ratings of diversiﬁcation goals resulted in six dimensions: (F1) Reduce Uncertainty and Risk; (F2) Grow and Service Markets; (F3) Enhanced Financial Condition; (F4) Individual Aspirations and Pursuits; (F5) Revenues Enhancement; and (F6) Family Connections. The study also examined the relationship between various entrepreneur and farm characteristics and the goal pursuit dimensions. Operator’s age, number of generations the farm had been in the family, household income, number of farm employees, and distance to an urbanized area inﬂuence types of goals pursued through diversiﬁcation.},

SMILE is a static and dynamic spatial microsimulation designed to analyse the impact of policy change and economic development on rural areas in Ireland. This paper focuses on the static model. First, we describe the European and Irish policy environment and indicate the importance of building spatial models to analyse change in rural Ireland. Second, we review existing literature on regional and local modelling techniques and the use of spatial models as tools for policy analysis. Third, we describe the SMILE static model. The model generates synthetic spatially referenced population for the Irish Republic at the small area level—the population micro data is produced for district electoral divisions (DEDs). Finally, we show how data from other sources can be linked to the static model output. We link data from the Irish National Farm Survey on farm system, income and off-farm employment of operator to the SMILE static model. We use this example to show its potential as a tool for policy analysis.},

We argue that this is a useful way of generating highly-detailed spatial maps of willingness to pay for environmental conservation, given the costs of collecting data. The data used in this study come from a discrete choice experiment survey of public preferences for the implementation of a new national forest management and protection programme in Poland. We combine these with high-resolution spatial data related to local forest characteristics. Using locally estimated discrete choice models we obtain location-specific estimates of willingness to pay (WTP). Variation in these estimates is explained by characteristics of the forests close to where respondents live. These results are compared with those obtained from a more typical, two stage procedure which uses Bayesian posterior means of the mixed logit model random parameters to calculate location-specific estimates of WTP. We find that there are indeed strong spatial patterns to the benefits of changes to the management to national forests. People living in areas with more species-rich forests and those living nearer bigger areas of mixed forests have significantly different WTP values than those living in other locations. This kind of information potentially enables a better distributional analysis of the gains and losses from changes to natural resource management, and better targeting of investments in forest quality.},

We use the results of choice experiments to assess both the costs incurred by the agent for the provision of biodiversity and the resulting social benefits. We also make a number of novel contributions such as the inclusion of a non-linear non-compliance detection curve, a sensitivity analysis to identify which parameter estimates have a critical impact on PAM results, and analysis of the efficiency of different sanction scenarios. The results suggest that: (i) the second-best solutions differ significantly from the optimal solutions attainable with perfect information, with farmers being strongly over-compensated for the extra costs associated with improved biodiversity; (ii) monitoring levels should be higher; (iii) the sanction system should be tougher. Sensitivity analysis shows the need for accurate estimates of the marginal cost of public funds and the costs and benefits associated with the public goods, which represent the key parameters determining PAM results.},

	abstract = {The farm size and productivity debate has been limited by the focus on land or labor productivity, generally showing respective productivity advantages to smaller or larger sized farms. Our purpose is to provide new perspectives on the debate by bringing together evidence from a set of novel case studies in both rich and poor countries. Common to them are the adoption of total factor productivity (TFP) as the comparative performance measure, and the reliance on panels of farm micro data. The present article presents a synthesis of findings from five case studies in (i) Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda; (ii) Bangladesh; (iii) Brazil; (iv) Australia; and (v) the United States. The preponderance of evidence from these studies suggests that there is no single economically optimal agrarian structure; rather, it appears to evolve with the stage of economic development. Certain farm sizes face relative productivity advantages, such as small farms in Africa. But with economic and market growth, that smallholder advantage will likely attenuate, moving toward constant and eventually increasing returns to size. Yet, importantly, small farms may be quite dynamic, and need not be a drag on agricultural growth until perhaps well into the development process.},

Features of Bangladesh’s agriculture help overcome several limitations in testing the inverse farm-size productivity relationship in other developing country settings. A Stochastic Production Frontier (SPF) model is applied using data from three rounds of a household panel survey to simultaneously estimate the production frontier and the technical inefficiency functions. The ‘correlated random effects’ approach is used to control for unobserved heterogeneous household effects. Methodologically, the results suggest that SPF models that ignore the inefficiency function are likely mis-specified, and may result in misleading conclusions on the farm size-productivity relationship. Empirically, the findings confirm that the farm size and productivity relationship is negative, but with the inverse relationship diminishing over time. Total factor productivity growth, driven by technical change, is found to have been robust across the sample. Across farm size groups, the relatively larger farmers experienced faster technical change, which helped them to catch up and narrow the productivity gap with the smaller farmers.},

To understand whether economies of size provided an incentive for the consolidation of production, the study estimates the total factor productivity (TFP) of five size classes of grain-producing farms in the U.S. Heartland (Corn Belt) region. Using quinquennial Agricultural Census data from 1982 to 2012 the study also compares TFP growth rates across farm sizes to gain insight into whether observed productivity differences are likely to persist. The finding of a strong positive relationship between farm size and TFP suggests that consolidation of production has contributed to recent aggregate productivity growth in the crop sector. The study estimates the extent to which sectoral productivity growth can be attributed to structural change versus other factors including technological change. The study also explores some tradeoffs associated with policies that raise the productivity of small versus large farms.},

We show that a positive farm-size productivity relationship could be linked to farmer capital choice.

	abstract = {Achieving sustainable food security and increased farm income will depend on how efficient production systems are in converting available inputs to produce outputs. Using data from Malawi, we estimate a Bayesian directional technology distance function to examine the relationship between farm size and technical efficiency. Our results support the existence of an inverse relationship between farm size and productive efficiency, where small farms are more efficient than large farms. On average, farms exhibit inefficiency levels of 60\%, suggesting that productivity could be improved substantially. Improving productive efficiency and food security will require farms to operate in ways where the size of cultivated area is matched by nonland production inputs such as labor, fertilizer, and improved seeds. The results highlight the need for policies that could incentivize farmers to adopt productivity-enhancing technologies and, where possible, to allocate excess land to lease markets.},

Erosion, pollution, sealing and decline of the organic matter are just some of the threats that affect one of the primary non-removable resources of the planet. Soils play a vital role in the biodiversity and are the provider of numerous Ecosystem Services that support human life on Earth. Following the withdrawal of the Soil Framework Directive proposal by the European Commission, we investigate how the different MS of the European Union (EU) address sustainable soil management under the pressures of different threats. The methodology used is based on a gap analysis applied to the instruments and/or policies adopted by the MS to contrast the various threats according to their specific level of intensity. The study presents for the first time a systematic review of the current EU policies covering all the regulatory instruments, the economic instruments, the information tools, the monitoring systems, and the research and innovation activities. The comparative analysis of the different approaches adopted by MS reveals the absence of a common EU strategy to address soil protection and the inefficacy of the subsidiary principle in the sustainable management of soil resources especially in the view of addressing the Sustainable Development Goals achieving the targets by 2030. Results show how the lack of a Soil Framework Directive has weakened the possibility to have strong coordination among the MS for soil protection. Each Country is adopting an autonomous legislative framework which reveals a huge dis-homogeneity and un-coherences among approaches.},

	abstract = {The number of young farmers has decreased over recent decades in several developed countries such as the United States and European countries. A recent strategy adopted by the European Union to address the resulting age imbalance is the Young Farmer Payment which provides an additional payment on top of the average basic payment introduced in the last Common Agricultural Policy reform. The objective of this study is to determine, by means of a behavioural approach, how this payment influenced the incentives of young farmers to stay in the farm. Using the endogenous succession cycle model and the structural modelling technique, we found that the payment affected young farmers’ willingness to stay through its influence on non-economic motivational goals. However, we also found that there are other factors that can be even more influential, such as pessimism about farming, community and family integration, participation in decision making, and the opinion of neighbours, among others. Based on the results, we argue that similar policies could be adopted in other countries, although policies would be more effective in addressing age imbalances if they are accompanied with complementary strategies aimed to deal with the identified social and psychological considerations.},

	abstract = {This study reviews the evolution of environmental land management and agri-environment schemes (AES) offered to farmers in England between 1979 and 2015 from the perspective of their potential to deliver landscape-scale, i.e. cross farm boundary, environmental benefits. The review uses population conservation theory, which underpinned the recommendations in the Lawton report (Lawton et al., 2010), to identify eight characteristics of these schemes with this potential. These characteristics form a framework which is used to assess the potential landscape-scale impacts of Countryside Stewardship, the AES recently introduced in England. The Mid Tier of Countryside Stewardship provides financial assistance to facilitators to help farmers organise and manage Farmer Groups. A Farmer Group must consist of four or more neighbouring farmers, who between them farm over 2,000 ha. Each member of a Farmer Group is required to submit an individual application, but each application must demonstrate that it “go[es] beyond [the environmental benefits that] could be delivered by individual holdings acting in isolation”. After the 2017 round, 98 Farmer Groups had been funded, involving 1915 farmer members, covering 451,064 ha. Primarily because of this innovation, Countryside Stewardship is considered to be the most landscape-scale orientated AES offered to farmers in England. A consideration of the evolution towards landscape-scale attributes in environmental land management schemes leads into a discussion of how future changes to four key AES characteristics – identified in the review – may influence how the landscape-scale dimension develops in the next generation of AES.},

Secondly, spatial distribution of future expenditure, according to latest 2014-2020 CAP reform, is analysed. In particular, we assess re-distributional effects connected with spatial spillovers that are due to regional economic integration. Assessment is made through the adoption of a multiregional I-O model. The analysis is carried out at a very high level of disaggregation, i.e. NUTS 3 level throughout the EU-27.

A critical appraisal of the CAP impact in terms of regional growth is carried out. Firstly from a strictly conceptual and methodological point of view, then by analysing more in detail how CAP reform (of both Pillar I and II) might have actually affected the role of the CAP in promoting (or hindering) regional growth and, therefore, convergence. Empirical evidence provided by the different available methodologies has progressively emerged in the very last years. Though a conclusive answer on the impact of the reform can not be drawn, it still emerges that the role of CAP design and implementation in affecting regional growth and convergence is usually underestimated and often neglected in the discussions about the future of the CAP. At the same time, however, this role is not univocal and strongly case-specific, as it substantially differs across regions according to their socio-economic structure and how reforms are jointly implemented.},

Population assumptions are stated separately from sampling assumptions, leading to simple statements as well as to important insights. The unified approach to linear and nonlinear models and to cross section and panel data enables straightforward coverage of more advanced methods. The numerous end-of-chapter problems are an important component of the book. Some problems contain important points not fully described in the text, and others cover new ideas that can be analyzed using tools presented in the current and previous chapters.

The ﬁndings show that in the process of CAP reform decision-making, European institutions justiﬁed the CAP with a transformation of key discourses (productivist, multi-functional and neo-liberal) by emphasising the hugely popular environmental element while, at the same time, employing a strong productivist discourse at the level of measures and the budgetary distribution between the EU member states and farmers’ groups. In order to retain a strong CAP as well as the current distribution of ﬁnancial resources, the European Commission, the European Parliament and the European Council employed greening as a justiﬁcation strategy as well as a productivist discourse as a major component in determining CAP measures.},

The farmers surveyed were mostly specialised in field cropping, dairy and beef. Respondents had to indicate their intentions in two CAP scenarios: firstly in a ‘CAP continuation scenario’; and secondly in a ‘No CAP scenario’ where the CAP would be fully removed from 2014 onwards. ‘Intentions’ relates to their intended ten-year strategy regarding exit and, for those intending to remain, to their use of production factors and diversification activities. The determinants of farm exits induced by the CAP removal were investigated using Probit models. In addition to descriptive statistics on intentions, a cluster analysis was performed to highlight the different effects of the CAP removal on the farmers' intentions, both in terms of exit and in terms of production factors and diversification activities. For the majority of respondents CAP removal would not change their intentions. However, around 21 percent who would remain in farming if the CAP were continued, would exit if the CAP were removed. The Probit models showed that farmers located in the Centre region and in less favoured areas were more likely to exit in the absence of the CAP while they would remain if the CAP continued, a result which contrasts with the determinants of ‘natural exits’, that is to say of exits whatever the scenario. The cluster analysis highlighted the fact that responses to the removal of the CAP varied across farm systems.},

Findings have shown that there has been a drop of inequality distribution in terms of financial subsidies in European farms allocated to strengthen the rural development.

A detailed set of indicators was developed by the commission and member states are required to use them to measure program success. To make results comparable requires that the methodology by which indicators are measured is well defined. However, this is not the case in this evaluation task. We take a small set of indicators and use two different approaches using the same sample and show that the results are deviating. We conclude that the success of this programme can only be compared across measures/regions when both, indicators and method are the same.},

We also control the potential endogeneity problem in the estimation of their impact. Our estimation results indicate that signiﬁcant convergence takes place, but that the funds have no impact on it. Simulation experiments show how investments targeted to the peripheral regions never spill over to their neighbours, which calls for a reconsideration of current regional policy tools.},

Farms have been stratified into functions of their typology of farming and their geographical localization. Research findings have pointed out that specialized farms as dairy farms and granivores ones have had the highest levels of technical efficiency compared to mixed farms and wine farms. To sum up, financial subsidies allocated by the Common Agricultural Policy have had a positive impact towards farmers, both increasing the technical efficiency and also in reducing the socio-economic marginalization of Bulgarian rural areas.},

	abstract = {A considerable body of research on farmers’ behaviour is based on the surveys regarding their behavioural intentions. The theory of planned behaviour states that while the formation of intentions normally precedes behaviour, several factors affect the realisation of the intended behaviour. Therefore, the usefulness of ex-ante surveys for predicting farmers’ behaviour requires more attention to reduce the potential biases in such analyses. The paper investigates how well the farmers’ intentions correspond with the behaviour in cases of farm exits, continuation of farming and farm size changes in Estonia. Based on the farm survey in 2007, the follow-up survey in 2011, and paying agency’s registry data, the ex-ante data on the intentions is combined with ex-post data on actual behaviour. A recursive bivariate probit regression is used to study the effects of selected socioeconomic characteristics on the probabilities of intended and realised behaviour, and the effects of stated intentions on actual behaviour. The results indicate that the usefulness of intentions in predicting actual behaviour differs, depending on the nature of the question in the farm life cycle context. Intentions are found to be a better predictor of actual behaviour when the considered event is regarded as positive (continuation of farming and farm growth) rather than negative (farm exit or farm shrinkage).},

This current paper aims to investigate the effects of such socioeconomic factors on the probabilities of farm growth, decline and exit relative to retaining the previous farm size. The survey and agricultural registers’ data are used for multinomial logit estimation. The results indicate that the farm growth probability is highest in the 40-49 year age group. The availability of successors significantly reduced farm exit probability, and the level of education of the farm operator increased the farm growth probability. While off-farm work was more probable in smaller farms and in cases of more educated and younger farm managers, it was evident that the off-farm employment of the farm operator significantly increased the probability of farm exit. While the larger farms have a higher probability of remaining in business, and lower probability to exit or decline, they do not have higher growth probability. Participation in a semi-subsistence farming scheme reduces the exit probability. It has been shown that farms founded during the beginning of transition due to restitution have lower decline and growth probabilities, indicating that such farmers are emotionally more inclined to maintain the farms of their forefathers.},

	abstract = {The investment support has been considered as a principal vehicle for enhancing competitiveness of the Czech agriculture since the early days of the economic transition. However so far, little attention has been paid to the evaluation of actual effects of the corresponding support programmes. The objective of this paper is to assess economic and other effects of the measure 121 “Modernisation of Agricultural Holdings” of the RDP 2007-2013 on the Czech farms. The counterfactual approach is adopted investigating what would have happened if the supported producers did not participate in the programme and then comparing the result indicators. The quantitative analysis of programme effects is complemented by a qualitative survey on 20 farms which received the investment support between 2008 and 2010. The quantitative assessment showed significant benefits of the investment support in terms of business expansion (GVA) and productivity (GVA/labour costs) improvements. These results were confirmed by the qualitative survey. It showed that production expansion and productivity increase were primary objectives of the investment strategies on most of the farms. The public support enabled farms to achieve these strategic objectives. The respondents of the survey declared that the supported investment was important for their prosperity however, we could not prove it in the quantitative assessment in terms of profit and cost/revenue ratio. Finally, the issue of deadweight of the investment support is discussed: the figures on very low net investment relatively to the provided public support at the sector level and answers of respondents indicate possible significant deadweight, however, the insight is incomplete, since it does not take into account post accession restructuring of the sector and multiannual and multi-enterprise character of investment at the farm level.},

Participants in AE schemes are found to significantly increase the area under cultivation (in particular grassland), resulting in a decrease of livestock densities. Furthermore, participation in AE programs significantly reduced the purchase of farm chemicals (fertilizer, pesticide). We also find substantial differences in the treatment effect between individual farms (heterogeneous treatment effects). Farms which can generate the largest benefit from the program are most likely to participate.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a theoretical model for adjustment costs and investment utilisation that illustrates their causes and types and shows in which phases of an investment they occur. Furthermore, we develop an empirical framework for analysing the size and the timing of adjustment costs and investment utilisation. We apply this methodology to a large panel data set of Danish pig producers with 9,281 observations between 1996 and 2008. The paper further contributes with a thorough discussion of the calculation and deflation of capital input from microeconomic data. We estimate an output distance function as a stochastic frontier model and explain the estimated technical inefficiencies with lagged investments, farm size and age of the farmer. We allow for interaction effects between these variables and derive the formula for calculating the marginal effects on technical efficiency. The results show that investments have a negative effect on farm efficiency in the year of the investment and the year after accruing from adjustment costs. There is a large positive effect on efficiency two and three years after the investment. The farmer’s age and the farm size significantly influence technical efficiency, as well as the effect of investments on adjustment costs and investment utilisation. These results are robust to different ways of measuring capital.},

	abstract = {Estonian municipalities have recently pa ssed an administrative reform that has resulted in the reorganisation of municipal management and decreased the number of municipalities. Unfortunately, no thorough scientific research has been done to find out whether the emerging helps to increase the ef ficiency. The aim of this paper is to estimate the efficiency of Estonian rural municipalities and to identify the factors that influence their efficiency. In this study we use a two stage analysis. In the first stage, we use the DEA Slacks - Based Model’s ( SBM) output - oriented approach. In the second stage, we use the Fractional Regression Model (FRM) to determine relevant exogenous factors that are associated with efficiency. 170 Estonian rural municipalities have been analysed. According to the DEA results , 28\% of municipalities (48) are efficient, the average efficiency of municipalities is 0.762. The analysis implies that there are considerable differences between smaller and larger rural municipalities. FRM results revealed that larger share of subsidies characterize inefficient municipalities. The weaker the municipality, the more state support the municipality must receive. A larger share of people with a higher education increases the efficiency, it is related to higher salaries and therefore higher re venue to the municipality. Elderly residents in the population increases the efficiency, however it isn’t sustainable in the long - run because more inputs are needed to offer various public services. The results indicate that the further away a municipality is from the capital, the more inefficient the municipality becomes.},

This is particularly the case for rural development measures whit voluntary participation and heterogeneous outcomes.

One of these promising methods is the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) approach. In this paper we apply PSM in order to obtain treatment effects from the agricultural investment support programme in Austria on the farm income. We also test the robustness of the results to hidden bias with sensitivity analysis. Furthermore we split the sample in more homogenous subsamples in order to increase the robustness of the results. The results show that treatment effects differ by a large amount for the subsamples and that splitting leads to slightly more robust results.},

Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice 2.9 can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network.

	abstract = {Presence-only data, point locations where a species has been recorded as being present, are often used in modeling the distribution of a species as a function of a set of explanatory variables---whether to map species occurrence, to understand its association with the environment, or to predict its response to environmental change. Currently, ecologists most commonly analyze presence-only data by adding randomly chosen "pseudo-absences" to the data such that it can be analyzed using logistic regression, an approach which has weaknesses in model specification, in interpretation, and in implementation. To address these issues, we propose Poisson point process modeling of the intensity of presences. We also derive a link between the proposed approach and logistic regression---specifically, we show that as the number of pseudo-absences increases (in a regular or uniform random arrangement), logistic regression slope parameters and their standard errors converge to those of the corresponding Poisson point process model. We discuss the practical implications of these results. In particular, point process modeling offers a framework for choice of the number and location of pseudo-absences, both of which are currently chosen by ad hoc and sometimes ineffective methods in ecology, a point which we illustrate by example.},

	abstract = {Although a recent rise in timber prices seems to counter the long-term trend of declining proﬁtability of timber production, the development of additional sources of income still constitutes a strategic challenge for forest enterprises. Furthermore, increasing interest of stakeholders in various forestry goods and services requires dealing comprehensively with the potentials of multifunctional forestry. In fact, forest enterprises may be engaged not only in providing a range of forestry-based outputs but also with ventures unrelated to forests. Nevertheless, there is still little empirical evidence concerning the economic signiﬁcance of diversiﬁcation. Established economic monitoring schemes traditionally concentrate on timber production. Political interest and forest certiﬁcation are typically restricted to forest-based activities. In this paper, the empirical evidence regarding auxiliary activities as documented by the Austrian accountancy network of larger forest enterprises is appraised for the ﬁrst time. A set of economic key ﬁgures can be derived for a considerable range of activities. On average, timber production is still dominating by far, other activities contributing in total only to an equivalent of some 2.5\% of the timber proﬁts. A range of methodical limitations associated with the data collected so far underpin the necessity to interpret results prudently. Several amendments are identiﬁed which could substantially improve the significance of the empirical investigations.},

	abstract = {The Chinese government has increasingly turned to agricultural industry policy as a means of promoting rural development, which have not necessarily led to an improvement in rural incomes nor to the achievement of other social and environmental goals. Emergy synthesis methods were applied to four agricultural production systems, i.e., two local traditional production systems as maize plantation and pond ﬁsh farming, one scaled Shaoxing duck (Anas Platyrhyncha var. domestica) rearing system, and one newly introduced specialty production system of common mushroom (Agaricus Bisporus) cultivation, in Weishan county of Shandong province of China in the year 2007, to assess and compare their environmental performances. Additionally, aiming at understanding the beneﬁts and driving forces of agricultural diversiﬁcation, environmental performance results were contrasted with traditional economic indicators. As indicated by EYR, ELR and ESI, it can be clearly shown that the scaled duck rearing and newly introduced common mushroom cultivation alternatives are not in a sustainable pattern, although having better economic performance than maize cropping and pond ﬁsh farming. Nevertheless, the development of rural agricultural diversiﬁcation is also affected by land accessibility, investment ability and even labor availability. Therefore, achieving a proﬁtable and environmental sustainable diversiﬁed farming system is not an easy task in Weishan area as well as in whole China. It is unwise to encourage development of agricultural diversiﬁcation in current manners without too much consideration on environmental degradation.},

	abstract = {Although farm-based tourism has a long tradition, particularly within Europe, farm diversiﬁcation into tourism has, in recent years, become more widely seen as an effective means of addressing the socio-economic problems of rural areas in general and the agricultural sector in particular. Accordingly, not only has there been signiﬁcant growth in the supply of farm-based tourism in many countries (and evidence of rural development policies supporting such growth), but also increasing academic attention has been paid to the phenomenon. However, although a number of studies consider speciﬁc issues related to farm diversiﬁcation into tourism, such as marketing or ﬁnancial challenges, little or no research has been undertaken into the attitudes of farming families that have diversiﬁed. The purpose of this paper is to address this omission in the tourism literature. Based on a survey of farms in north-eastern England, it explores farmers’ attitudes to a variety of issues related to diversiﬁcation into tourism, including the socio-cultural context within which it occurs. In doing so, it both conﬁrms and challenges previously held assumptions regarding the problems of diversiﬁcation. In particular, however, it identiﬁes a widespread desire amongst farmers to maintain a distinction between the farm/farming business, suggesting that the development of farm tourism enterprises is an employment, as opposed to diversiﬁcation, issue. It concludes, therefore, that the role of public sector agencies in the support of farm tourism should be reassessed.},

This paper answers the question whether a sequence of observations from a process follow the same statistical distribution, and if not, where the exact change points are, so that observations within two consecutive change points follow the same distribution. We propose two different methods based on likelihood ratio test and cluster analysis to detect multiple change points when observations follow non-stationary Poisson process with diverse occurrence rates over time.

A microeconomic approach is employed, based on firm data from FAME dataset combined with detailed subsidies information from DEFRA. The generalised method of moments (system GMM) is used to estimate the effect of CAP payments in both static and dynamic models of employment. The results suggest positive net spillovers of CAP payments to non-farm employment. Although the magnitude of the effect is small, it is economically significant. In general, Pillar 1 has a stronger positive employment effect relative to Pillar 2.

	abstract = {This paper examines the potential impact of agricultural and trade policy reform on land-use across the EU focussing particularly on the issue of land abandonment. Using a novel combined application of the well established CAPRI and Dyna-CLUE models it estimates the extent of change across Europe under removal of Pillar 1 support payments and trade liberalisation. Overall, it is estimated that around 8 per cent less land will be farmed under these reforms than under the baseline situation. However, some regions, areas and farm types face more signiﬁcant reductions. The reforms are particularly felt on livestock grazing farms situated in the more marginal areas of Europe, which also coincide with areas of high nature value. Therefore, farmland biodiversity is likely to be reduced in these areas. However, using a range of environmental indicators, relating to nutrient surpluses, GHG emissions, soil erosion and species abundance, an overall improvement in the environmental footprint of agriculture is likely. In addition, the economic efﬁciency of the agricultural sector will probably improve. The paper considers several possible options available to deal with any negative aspects of land abandonment. Following the FAO (2006), it is argued that untargeted, rather general agricultural policy measures which maintain land in production are likely to be an ineffective and inefﬁcient way to address the perceived negative consequences of abandonment. A more holistic approach to rural development is required, tailored to the speciﬁc context within each area.},

We explore whether this is true by conducting an econometric ex post evaluation of the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in the three East German States Brandenburg, Saxony, and Saxony-Anhalt. Whereas previous studies have employed descriptive statistics or qualitative methods and have looked at single policy instruments in isolation, we apply a difference-in-differences estimator to analyze the employment effects of the entire portfolio of CAP measures simultaneously. Based on panel data at the county level, we ﬁnd that investment aids and transfers to less-favored areas had a zero marginal employment effect. We present evidence that full decoupling of direct payments in 2005 led to labor shedding, as it made transfer payments independent of factor allocation. Spending on modern technologies in processing and marketing and measures aimed at the development of rural areas led to job losses in agriculture. Agrienvironmental measures, on the other hand, kept labor-intensive technologies in production or induced them. This analysis calls into question whether an expansion of existing second pillar measures is a reasonable way to use funds modulated away from the ﬁrst pillar.},

Theoretically, agricultural land rents are a function of expected market returns and expected associated direct payments. The unobservable nature of expected returns means that actual market returns must be used as a proxy for the former in the empirical speciﬁcation. As a consequence, the problem of bias due to expectation error arises. Using a GMM technique to take account of this problem, the results of this study show that the impact of CAP direct payments on rental values depends on the type of payment and on the nature of the production characteristics of the associated agricultural commodity.},

In most empirical studies on farmers’ decision making for diversiﬁcation, geographical information is either omitted or reduced to a variable that links the farm to an administrative unit. Therefore, the inﬂuence of the exact farm location on farmers’ decision making is often lacking. The paper addresses the role of location, in terms of site speciﬁc natural conditions as well as neighboring dynamics, in inﬂuencing farmers’ decision making to diversify. Moreover, it investigates to what extend low returns from primary production stimulate farmers to ﬁnd new survival strategies, and therefore explains diversiﬁcation. The Gelderse Vallei area, a region in the center of the Netherlands, is used as a case study. For this area an extensive farm survey data could be combined with topographic data and soil maps (GIS). Both the number of activities as well as the kind of activities that are taken up are analyzed. Landscape attractiveness turns out to be a driver of diversiﬁcation. Daily recreation most frequently occurs close to national parks, green services are more likely to occur on relatively wet soils. Activities resulting from diversiﬁcation might produce positive externalities: new activities have the tendency to emerge next to already existing ones, therewith explaining the formation of “hotspots” in the landscape. Finally, diversiﬁcation was found to be sensitive to returns from primary agriculture production.},

These factors are then used to model biodiversity with a species-based indicator on a 1 km scale in the EU27. The Common Agricultural Policy Regionalised Impact Modelling System (CAPRI) is used to conduct the economic analysis and Dyna-CLUE (Conversion of Land Use and its Effects) is used to model land use changes. An indicator that expresses the relative species richness was used as the indicator for biodiversity in agricultural areas. The methodology is illustrated with a baseline scenario and two scenarios that include a speciﬁc policy. The strength of the methodology is that impacts of economic policy instruments can be linked to changes in agricultural production, prices and incomes, on the one hand, and to biodiversity effects, on the other e with land use and land-use intensity as the connecting drivers. The method provides an overall assessment, but for detailed impact assessment at landscape, farm or ﬁeld level, additional analysis would be required.},

	abstract = {Farm diversiﬁcation has been prominently supported by agricultural policy makers aiming to support rural development. To increase the understanding of determinants inﬂuencing diversiﬁcation and hence to increase the efﬁciency of policies aiming to support farm diversiﬁcation this paper presents the results of an analysis of diversiﬁcation determinants. The research investigates Dutch farms diversiﬁcation strategies using Farm Structural Survey (FSS) data of 2011 including 70,392 farms. The study uses a binary logit model to determine the characteristics inﬂuencing the diversiﬁcation decision in general. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis for six diversiﬁcation strategies was conducted. Additionally the study categorised the speciﬁc diversiﬁcation activities in order to estimate a multinomial probit model, analysing three choice categories simultaneously. This enables us to compare determinants of farm diversiﬁcation in general with determinants of speciﬁc activities. The analysis includes socio- demographic, economic and geophysical farm characteristics assumed to inﬂuence the diversiﬁcation decision. Even though diversiﬁcation is largely inﬂuenced by similar determinants, we ﬁnd differences that are most pronounced for the adoption of nature conservation strategies. Consequently, it is important for policy makers to target policies at speciﬁc diversiﬁcation activities in order to increase efﬁciency.},

This paper reports results of a socio-economic study carried out among Belgian farmers, focusing speciﬁcally on the opportunities offered by different forms of diversiﬁcation. Analyses from in-depth interviews indicate the possible role of new activities in the survival of many farms. The curative potential of this strategy is, however, strongly conditioned by the availability of capital within the household. Therefore, off-farm employment is often the most accessible strategy, not only for the survival of the household, but also for supplementing the income necessary to maintain the farm activities.},

	abstract = {Little work has considered explicitly the role of farm tenancy in inﬂuencing the uptake (or not) of diversiﬁcation activities. The need to examine this link has been heightened because of the 2003 CAP reforms and the decision to tie Single Farm Payment (SFP) entitlement to the land rather than what is produced on that land. The main objective of this paper, therefore, is to examine the nature of diversiﬁcation activities on tenant farms in England, which includes a consideration of how the introduction of the SFP and other CAP reforms may inﬂuence such restructuring processes. Results from a national postal survey, supported by tenant farmer/landlord interviews and a workshop, reveal high rates of farm diversiﬁcation on farms with tenanted land. However, if one takes away contract/hire services the rate of diversiﬁcation on tenant farms is much less. Tenant farms appear to favour more ‘traditional’ diversiﬁcation activities and the results also demonstrate an increasing need to move towards more ‘encultured’ deﬁnitions of farm diversiﬁcation. The second key ﬁnding to emerge from the research relates to the high levels of uncertainty and negativity surrounding the potential impacts of the CAP reforms, and SFP in particular, on farm business behaviour. Tenant farmers were more concerned about levels of SFP and entitlement than future investment decisions, including diversiﬁcation.},

Unlike the non-spatial case, long-run regional income levels depend on: own region as well as neighbouring region characteristics, the spatial connectivity structure of the regions, and the strength of spatial dependence. Given this, the search for regional characteristics that exert important influences on income levels or growth rates should take place using spatial econometric methods that account for spatial dependence as well as own and neighbouring region characteristics, the type of spatial regression model specification, and weight matrix. The framework adopted here illustrates a unified approach for dealing with these issues.},

A knowledge gap exists as to how farmers’ decisions to engage in nonagricultural activities, or to continue farming at all, is affected by landscape characteristics and the farm’s location in the urban–rural system. This paper presents the results of research concerning the impact of spatial factors on diversiﬁcation activities and farm abandonment. Based on a survey conducted among 147 farms in a case study area in Eastern Germany, spatially explicit data on farmers’ diversiﬁcation activities and exit strategies were analysed using two spatial typologies that classify rural attractiveness and farm location on an urban–rural gradient. Results show that while rural attractiveness positively affects the farmers’ decision-making to diversify activities, the degree of urbanisation encourages farm holders to continue farming activity, i.e., the proximity and accessibility to urban consumer markets. Diversiﬁcation rather seems to be associated with rurality and touristic development and not so much with the proximity to urban consumer markets.},

The aim was to measure the overall impact of all of the Rural Development Funds, covering all measures within the program. Two indices of local well-being were used: the multi-dimensional, local-variables-based Regional Development Index that measures the overall level of regional development and a simple, migration-based index as a proxy for perceived quality of life. Generalized propensity score matching, and difference-in-differences estimation techniques were employed to evaluate the impact of subsidies. Irrespective of how the amount of support was calculated, the measure of local well-being, or the methodology employed, the impact was not signiﬁcant, and was sometimes even negative. This casts doubt on the effectiveness of Rural Development Policy in Hungary.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the relationship between EU agricultural subsidies, including agri-environmental subsidies, and the outflow of labor from agriculture. We use more representative subsidy indicators and a wider coverage (panel data from 210 EU regions over the period 2004-2014) than has been used before. The data allow to better correct for sample selection bias than previous empirical studies. We find that, on average, CAP subsidies reduce the outflow of labor from agriculture, but the effect is almost entirely due to decoupled Pillar I payments. Coupled Pillar I payments have no impact on reducing labor outflow from agriculture, i.e. on preserving jobs in agriculture. The impact of overall Pillar II is mixed, but agri-environmental payments strongly reduce the outflow of labor from agriculture. Our estimates predict that an increase of 10 percent of the CAP budget would prevent an extra 16,000 people from leaving the EU agriculture sector each year. A 10 percent decoupling would save 13,000 agricultural jobs each year. However, the budgetary costs are large. The estimated cost exceeds € 300,000 per year (or € 25,000 per month) per job saved in agriculture.},

This discussion on the driving forces of CAP reform links to broader theoretical questions on the role of budgetary politics, globalisation of public policy and paradigm shift in explaining policy change. In this article, the Health Check reforms of 2007/2008 are assessed. They were probably more ambitious than first supposed, although it was a watered-down package agreed by ministers in November 2008. We conclude that the Health Check was not primarily driven by budget concerns or by the supposed switch from the state-assisted to the multifunctional policy paradigm. The European Commission's wish to adopt an offensive negotiating stance in the closing phases of the Doha Round was a more likely explanatory factor. The shape and purpose of the CAP post-2013 is contested with divergent views among the Member States.},

This article contributes to this debate by looking at the influence of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on the European Union’s (EU) Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). It shows that the transfer of authority to international institutions may transform an external factor into a permanent influence on domestic policy. The transfer of authority in agriculture to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT – now included in the WTO) in 1994 led to the introduction of a dormant clause on export subsidies in all subsequent EU CAP regulations. This clause provided the legal foundation for the 2015 EU decision to remove export subsidies. Multilateral pressure (i.e. the demands of third countries in GATT/WTO negotiations) is not the only determinant of CAP, but it is important, and affected by the GATT/WTO having authority on agriculture.},

	abstract = {A core claim about agricultural policy making is that it is ‘compartmentalized’ and ‘exceptional’. In this picture, the policy process is insulated from other policy concerns, has a distinctive system of actors and institutional structures, and is rooted in extensive governmental intervention in the market and the redistribution of resources from taxpayers to food producers. Recently there have been suggestions that a ‘post-exceptional’ agricultural politics has emerged, which is more market-driven, has reduced state intervention, and where policies reflect influences relating to non-food issues such as the environment. This contribution discusses the concepts of compartmentalization and exceptionalism and then applies ‘indicators of change’ to a case study of the 2013 reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). It concludes that the reform provides evidence for ‘shallow’ post-exceptionalism where a historically persistent agricultural policy subsystem has opened up to new actors, incorporated some programme change but left the ideational framework largely intact.},

The overall hypothesis is that intensiveness of agricultural production corresponds to the willingness to reform the CAP. Political CAP positions, together with the development of member states’ structural fundamentals, are analysed using cluster analysis. The results show that EU enlargements have extensified agricultural production at the EU level, and that extensive agricultural production in a member state is often an indicator of reduced willingness to reform. However, the intensiveness of agricultural production is only part of the explanation. Moreover, negotiation tactics play an important role for the positions on the CAP.},

	abstract = {This article addresses the core research question – how can we understand the policy processes leading to the 2003 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform? It utilizes the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) perspective as an explanatory framework for these purposes in a European Union (EU) policy area which normally lies outside ACF applications. In the ACF, it is assumed that advocacy coalitions will resist information that challenges the policy core beliefs of decision actors. This characteristic is even stronger in semi-federalist systems such as the EU. Hence, a high degree of consensus is required to change the policy core, as was the case with the 2003 CAP reform. The article shows that the ACF can be expanded to explain the CAP reform. It also demonstrates that the preconditions identified by the ACF for a successful consensus process were fulfilled in the reform process. The onset of the BSE crisis and the emergent international trade negotiations meant that the status quo was no longer unacceptable. Most of the negotiations leading up to the CAP reform were held in private and took a great deal of time. Commissioner Fischler was willing to act as facilitator in the process and strove to make the reform process as non-normative as possible. However, in order to accommodate the criticism of the ACF for not taking collective action problems serious, it is also observed that new forms of non-trivial coordination occurred, namely discursive coordination, which became the most frequently used form of coordination during the 2003 CAP reform process and which is much less problematic as far as collective action problems are concerned.},

Regression analysis is used to evaluate the relationship between allocated funds (dependent variable) and factors of territorial disadvantage (explanatory variables) covering the 20-year period 1994-2013 and approximately 90\% of total Community expenditure. The analysis reveals that both coordination and compatibility with territorial cohesion of the various areas of Community policy have not always improved in response to major policy reforms. The territorial ‘vocation’ of overall Community spending is weakly linked to its distribution among different policies, but it crucially depends upon how each policy area defines appropriate allocation mechanisms and interventions, based upon the characteristics of each region and its ‘local’ needs.},

This point was briefly addressed with respect to global Moran’s I, but it has not been widely used. One reason may be that the most commonly used spatial analysis and GIS software packages do not support power analysis. Thus, apart from using the code for saddle-point approximation, applications have been restricted to employing normal approximations. An implementation of the exact distributions for global and local Moran’s I, which are integrated into the R-package spdep, is presented. Furthermore, assuming a simultaneous autoregressive spatial data generating scheme, substantial cases are provided, demonstrating the drawbacks and potential flaws of using the normal approximation in power calculations. The results confirm that, particularly for local Moran’s I, due to the smallness of sets of neighborhoods, this practice may potentially lead to errors of inference. An example concerned with Upper-Austrian migration, where using the exact distribution leads to different conclusions, is presented as well.},

However, most of the current studies ignored the effects of social connections on the spatial distribution of rural settlements. This study proposed a multi-objective spatial reconstruction model for rural settlements based on the particle swarm optimization algorithm. The model considers intervillage social connections as one of the reconstruction objectives together with land-use quantity, spatial compactness, land-use suitability and relocation distance. Based on a questionnaire survey, the social connection strength between villages was measured from spatial and nonspatial aspects. The model was calibrated for the Chengui Township of Hubei Province in Central China. Five modeling scenarios for rural settlement reconstruction were designed according to potential development modes used in practice. A comparison of the reconstruction results of the different scenarios was performed to verify the applicability of the model and to analyze the joint interaction of the spatial objectives and social connections during the restructuring of rural settlements. The results indicated that five scenarios were effectively and robustly implemented using the proposed model. Social connections had a direct effect by guiding the restructuring direction of rural settlements. This study advances our understanding of the influence of social connections on rural settlement reconstruction and provides a useful exploratory tool for policymakers and rural planners in formulating reasonable reconstruction plans.},

This paper argues that growth regressions and regression discontinuity analysis focusing on regional growth do not provide sufficient detail to support policy-makers in intervention design. A more nuanced picture would be achieved by unpacking intervention in different policy areas at the micro-level and analyzing the channels through which policy contributes to economic growth. The paper reviews the main direct and indirect transmission channels in three areas: research and innovation; support to enterprises; and infrastructure. In this respect, impact evaluations at beneficiary and, in particular, firm level offer a rich potential source of evidence and need to be systematically built into data collection and evaluation of post-2020 Cohesion Policy.},

	abstract = {The effects of globalization have often been adverse for the agricultural sector, especially its most vulnerable element—the small farm. The importance of the agricultural sector as a whole and small farms in the sense of ensuring food security, employment and viability of rural areas, implies a necessity to support the sector and small farms in particular. For this purpose, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Union (EU) seeks to boost the sustainability of agriculture in multiple dimensions. The 2013 reform of the CAP has provided a particularly strong impetus towards this direction. This paper establishes an indicator system to quantify the effects of the CAP direct payments on the socioeconomic sustainability of small farms. Expert survey and multi‐criteria assessment are used to this end. The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method is applied for the multi‐criteria analysis. Lithuania is taken as a case study. The results show that, in the case of Lithuania, the direct payment system did not contribute to the improvement in socioeconomic sustainability of small farms up until 2013 CAP reform when its impact became undeniable.},

In this reform 'single farm payments' have been introduced which are based on direct payments during the reference period 2000-2002. We use statistics of such payments to explore the distribution patterns across farm holdings in EU member states. The results show, that direct payments are skewed towards a small number of very large holdings in a few member states. To show their distributional consequences on farm household incomes, we use data from the Farm Accountancy Data network in Austria. The analysis shows that direct payments do not contribute towards a more equal income distribution of farm households.},

The Agenda 2000 reform of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) introduced rural development as an integrated part of agricultural policy. The present study focuses on the second pillar of CAP. Multifunctional farming, more than any other rural activity, has a role to play in integrating the natural environment with the cultural landscape and socio-economic development. The question of how multifunctional agriculture can facilitate sustainable rural development is addressed in terms of mechanisms and inherent possibilities. Results from a case study in Östergötland in Sweden are discussed in relation to five other European case studies. Some main findings are that Pillar 2 has made it possible for rural inhabitants to continue living in rural areas and that the policies are effective in identifying and supporting new opportunities for farm diversification. The traditional agricultural landscape can be seen as a key component in various diversification activities in rural areas, contributing to economic as well as social and environmental sustainability.},

This paper assesses the appropriateness of the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for meeting rural development challenges in the New Member States (NMS). It argues that while the mitigation of structural problems confronting rural areas in these countries is critical to meeting the challenge of effectively integrating Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) into the European Union, the CAP is poorly suited to this task. Overall, the CAP was insufficiently reformed to accommodate CEE accession effectively and it represents a failure of the European Union to adjust adequately from an exclusively Western European institution into an appropriate pan-European organization.

On the one hand, the study assesses the costs of coordinating farmers for the implementation of the programs, as a complement or alternative to increasing the amount of land set aside for said programs. On the other hand, the paper responds to recent calls about the need to identify incentives other than monetary payments to promote farmers participation. Methodologically, the study consists of a choice experiment exploring the willingness of farmers in Germany, Switzerland, and Spain to participate in a tree planting measure. According to our findings, the resistance of farmers to participate in coordinated programs is not insurmountable and has to do with transaction costs as well as beliefs about other farmers’ behavior. Similarly, having conservation programs recommended by farmers can encourage other farmers to participate. Finally, different conservation framings can affect the resistance of farmers to participate depending on the emphasis made on the environmental benefits that farmers obtain from the programs. Overall, the findings illustrate the interest of further integrating farmers in the design of agro-environmental schemes and, further testing the feasibility of coordinated schemes in light of the influence of both monetary and social incentives.},

	abstract = {Human migration is a direct indicator of rural attraction. As the world's most populous nation, China is experiencing a rural population decline. The government is actively focusing on a rural revitalization strategy to make rural areas sustainable. Based on data from the sixth census in 2010, this paper applies the Moran's I method and spatial lag regression model to analyze the spatial pattern and driving factors of China's rural migration. The main conclusions are listed as follows. (1) The areas, including the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, and the northwestern areas, were the most attractive destinations for rural migrants. (2) The inter-provincial rural migration pattern is close to the total rural migration pattern, but is different from the intra-provincial pattern. (3) In general, job opportunities in the secondary industry, rural income, rural investment, and the local economic levels were all main drivers for rural migration. The driving mechanisms varied in the eastern, central, and western provinces. To support China's efforts in rural revitalization, regionally different policies, urban-rural integration, and new economic factors are suggested and highlighted from the perspective of rural migration.},

	abstract = {Rural decline is an inevitable process as human society transforms from the agrarian to the urban-industrial economy, and further on to the knowledge economy. Through an extensive literature review, this paper aims to interpret why some rural areas decline while some others do not. The findings show that it is by the interactions between rural areas and the external environment that rural communities either grow, decline or even vanish. The paper emphasizes the necessity to improve rural communities' resilient capacity through adjusting their internal components' function and structure to survive the external changes. In this process, rural livelihood diversification, the creation of market oriented institutions and strong social capital are considered to enhance rural resilience and build up sustaining rural communities. Finally, three conditions for sustainable rural development in the knowledge economy are discussed: 1) development of new economic activities that can respond to potential urban demand; 2) local entrepreneurship that can establish and expand these new activities; and 3) social capital that can support the entrepreneurship in new activities with access to credits, labor, human capital, external markets and external knowledge for learning and innovation.},

	abstract = {The European Union reformed farm policy in June 2003 towards the decoupling of farm income support instruments. Available impact studies find that this reform reduces production incentives substantially for beef and to a lesser extent for arable crops. However, these studies assume that the previous reform, under Agenda 2000, already decoupled arable crop direct payments to a considerable extent, while beef premiums were linked more closely to production. Our main objective in this paper is to test the sensitivity of these results to this questionable modelling of Agenda 2000 direct payments, which neglects eligibility rules and land market imperfections. Our analysis reveals that the effects of the reform on both arable crop and beef production are always negative, however the Agenda 2000 direct payments are modelled. On the other hand, we show that, when the eligibility rules and land market imperfections are acknowledged, the production reducing effects may be much larger for arable crops than for beef. Policy implications of these results are noted.},

	abstract = {We evaluate the overall economic effects of decoupled agricultural payments in Finland. The EU Common Agricultural Policy reform implemented in 2006 means shifting farm subsidies from production output and capital to farmland. Since decoupling seems to be a prominent trend in agricultural policy, we also simulate a case in which some national subsidies are decoupled from production as well. The decoupled support is tied equally to the hectares of arable land owned by farmers, other entrepreneurs, white and blue collar workers, pensioners and other households. This study takes the ownership structure of farmland between these household groups explicitly into account. We evaluate the overall impact of these changes on agricultural production, income and the welfare of various households. The computable general equilibrium GemRur simulation model of Finland is our working tool. We find that decoupling farm payments from production, especially if extended to national subsidies, will increase agricultural and food prices and decrease agricultural and food production. The decoupling has the greatest impact on the income and welfare of farmers. The impacts on other households and sectors are clearly smaller but not negligible.},

	abstract = {Rural land-use in the European Union (EU) is strongly influenced by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) because it directly affects the relative profitability of different land-use options. Since 2000, the CAP has been heavily reformed. In particular, in Sweden, the 2003 CAP reform was followed by substantial shifts in agricultural land allocation. However, this land-use change has barely been studied empirically beyond the net changes of land-use categories. In order to better understand the transformation of the land-use system, all transitions between land-use categories and changes within existing categories need to be considered. This article presents an analysis of agricultural land-use change between 2002 and 2010 in a landscape in southern Sweden. The inter-category land transitions were identified and quantified by using a spatially explicit field-level resolution dataset. The intra-category change of utilization intensity was assessed for grasslands by using standard yields and forage consumption estimates. Substantial shifts in chains of connected inter-category land transitions were found between cereals, temporary grasses, permanent pastures and fallow lands. The grassland utilization analysis showed a growing gap between grassland area and forage consumption. These results indicate concentration of agricultural production to better quality land and a growing number of land-idling farms in the region. The CAP single farm payment scheme is discussed in the light of these findings.},

Our results indicate that cotton production gradually decreases as more decoupled policies are adopted. Moreover, the fully decoupled payment is found to be non-production neutral since it indirectly affects producers’ decisions through the wealth effect. Katranidis, Stelios D.; Kotakou, Christina A.},

Using a panel dataset over the period 2004–2010, we compare the results obtained from pooled-OLS and dynamic panel GMM estimators.

	abstract = {This paper reports on the use of a spatial analysis framework to assess the consequences for business incomes of alternative area-bases for Pillar 1 CAP Single Farm Payments, integrating spatial data from both biophysical and socio-economic domains. The results from the Scotland analysis are likely to have wider significance for policy makers confronting decisions on how best to implement reforms of Pillar 1 CAP payments elsewhere in the EU. Introduction of area-based payment to replace historic entitlement is particularly challenging in regions with a wide range of bio-physical conditions that are spatially heterogeneous and only weakly related to intensity of agricultural use, management or previous support. The analysis shows that, while the basis of payments and payment rates can have substantial effects on the nature of the impact, it is the change to an area-based payment system alone that has the biggest redistributive impact. For Scotland, there are larger numbers of businesses that gain rather than lose, and, because the average losses are much larger than the average gains, a move towards area-based payments is likely to encounter strong opposition and only weak support from the agricultural community. In all the options for area-based payments examined, there is substantial redistribution between agricultural sub-sectors and between geographical regions. Substantial reductions in support affect agricultural sub-sectors that are significant for the wider agri-food sector (cereals, general cropping, dairy and lowland livestock) and regions where agriculture plays a significant role in the economy (particularly south-west Scotland). Yet the greater redistribution quantified by this research is within sub-sectors; that is from businesses with more intensive management to those with more extensive. Such within-sector redistributions will have policy significance and mean that analysis of the consequences of area-based payment options conducted only at sub-sectoral level is likely to be inadequate. It is concluded that the analysis approach used has successfully revealed the potential consequences of area-based CAP support payment options and this has been of direct value by informing ongoing negotiations on reform of the CAP. However, the research also highlights the serious challenges that remain in defining schemes that meet the objectives of policy makers, can be administered cost-effectively and are politically acceptable. The research may thus have implications for other EU member states considering how best to implement area-based Pillar 1 payment schemes.},

	abstract = {While the evolution of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) until 2013 is clear, European Union (EU) budgetary pressures and the perceived unfairness of the distribution of CAP support across Member States has lead to uncertainty over the design of the CAP post 2013. One comprehensive reform option being considered is the implementation of an EU wide flat area payment (EUWFAP) system and a reduction of the total budget available for direct payments. It is hypothesised that the implementation of this policy proposal would lead to significant changes in the distribution of the EU budget and to the redistribution of agricultural production between the Member States, which could hinder the implementation of the proposal. This paper evaluates the rationality of the EUWFAP, based on the analysis of its budgetary and market impacts. Using the AGMEMOD 2020 combined model, the introduction of the EUWFAP in 2013 is compared with a baseline continuation of the current policy. Results suggest that there would be minor negative impacts on the agricultural production at the EU level, but that more substantial impact for some commodities, most notably beef, and could occur in the individual EU Member States. An important outcome of such a policy reform would be a substantial change in the budget allocation between Member States, which could help mitigate the budgetary tensions between the Member States.},

However, up to now no comprehensive assessment of the territorial impacts of the CAP has been achieved. This article summarises the main findings of a recent study which was carried out under the European Union's ESPON programme on this issue. The regional analysis suggests that, at present, the CAP is not contributing towards the goal of more balanced and sustainable development across European territory. This finding is both valid for the more “traditional” CAP (Pillar 1) and the Rural Development measures, referred to as Second Pillar measures, indicating the emerging priority for these types of instruments. Yet, the great variation in the RDP priorities and implementation in the Member States underscore the wide scope for taking account of the spatial dimension more explicitly. In addition, the numerous best practice examples and the political support for RD action point to the untapped potential of local activities in rural areas. Strengthening the link to the spatial cohesion objectives is therefore a prerequisite for securing support by European citizens for future CAP payments.},

	abstract = {In this paper the price volatility of land in Poland is examined during the years 1992-2016. The analysis concentrates particularly on stationarity, variation and GARCH. Differences in land price changes in particular provinces in Poland are presented and land prices in Poland are compared with other EU countries. The land market in Poland is diverse. Purchasers can buy land from private owners in the market and from the government’s Agricultural Property Agency. Generally, land offered by the Agricultural Property Agency is cheaper, but it is also more difficult to purchase. The authors of the paper used and analyzed quarterly price data from the main Statistical Office in Warsaw in PLN. The survey found high variability for land prices in Poland. The price of agricultural land has increased significantly since the integration of Poland into the EU. In 2016 the average price of land from the (APA) Agricultural Property Agency increased by 791\% and the average price of private agricultural land increased by 690.2\% in comparison to 2004. The prices of land differ regionally in Poland. In 2016 compared to 2005 the price of land increased the most in Warmińsko-Mazurskie voivodeship (587,2\%), Opolskie voivodeship (547,8\%) and Lubuskie voivodeship (534,9\%). In 2016 in comparison to 2005 the price of agricultural land increased the least in Małopolskie voivodeship (252,6\%), Podlaskie voivodeship (295,0\%) and Łódzkie voivodeship (304,9\%). The study presents the descriptive statistics of agricultural land. The coefficient of variation of price changes in the years 2005-2016 was the highest in Slovakia (69,8\%), Romania (60,4\%) and Estonia (59,4\%) and the lowest in Italy (9,2\%) and France (12,1\%). The ADF test (Augmented Dickey-Fuller test) shows that the agricultural land prices data can be classified as not stationary. The implication of the GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model of price volatility of agricultural land is that conditional volatility cannot be confirmed.},

Despite longstanding interventions to promote specialist agricultural education, farmer attainment metrics remain disappointing. Likewise participation rates in lifelong learning are much lower for farmers than for the working population generally. Based on experience in other sectors, there is potential to apply measures on minimum practitioner competency, practitioner accreditation and continuing professional development to agriculture. As part of this policy framework, a share of the future EU agriculture budget should be placed in a Knowledge Fund to be allocated in the form of Knowledge Vouchers. Given ingrained barriers to change that must be overcome, farmers using Knowledge Vouchers to finance training, skills and competency development should be rewarded with a cash payment. Farmers that do not engage in education and lifelong learning would see subsidy payments reduced. The prescribed policy change would improve overall value for public money and align with proposals for Member States to develop Strategic Plans to meet economic, environmental and social objectives, as part of post-2020 CAP reforms.},

Results indicate that payments do not induce output-biased technical change. We do find evidence of Hicksian bias that is land using and material input saving attributable to support payments.

	abstract = {High Nature Value farmland (HNVf) are characterised by high naturalness of land cover and low intensity of agricultural practices. They are essential for biodiversity conservation in rural environments, and their presence is an important indicator of the effectiveness of different EU policies that aim to support biodiversity in agricultural areas. Consequently, their identification, protection and implementation is of strategic importance. Previous studies have analysed the landscape along an urban-rural-natural gradient, beginning with Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) maps. Building up from this baseline, this paper integrates spatial analysis methods with statistical data related to agricultural practices and their intensity, with the aim of mapping and assessing HNVf in a portion of the Veneto Plain, north-east Italy. In particular, this paper presents a methodology for the identification of HNVf applied to two datasets: (i) the first encompassing only LULC data and (ii) the second encompassing also statistical data on agricultural practices. The aim is to demonstrate how this additional information improves the identification of HNVf. In the first step, a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) technique is applied to a reclassified LULC map, in order to calculate continuous intensity indicators. A Principal Components Analysis and an ISODATA Cluster Analysis are then performed respectively to remove redundant information and to identify the different landscape structures of the study area. The second analysis follows the same steps, with the difference that LULC intensity indicators are analysed in combination with data on crop rotations, irrigation and livestock from a census survey. The first analysis returns a map of the landscape driven only by different intensities of land use. The second returns a map where the statistics on agricultural practices allow for a better characterisation of the natural value of the landscape. Agricultural statistics improved the results, since they allow the discrimination of lower intensity clusters within the cultivated areas, which are traditionally excluded from HNVf by considering only the land cover. The comparison between the results of the two analyses shows that the combined use of the agricultural statistics determines a more detailed representation of the study area, that allows a better differentiation of the agricultural areas between HNVf and non-HNVf, leading to an improvement of the HNVf identification methodology. The benefit of using additional information can be therefore of interest for territorial planning, with the ultimate aim of promoting biodiversity conservation.},

Using the French Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN), we computed an intensity indicator based on input costs per ha (“IC/ha”). Common variables between the FADN and four other datasets were included in a two steps multinomial regression to estimate the IC/ha value of each Small Agricultural Region (“SAR”, units with homogeneous agro-ecological characteristics with mean width = 22.4 km). The local indicator of spatial association was used to reveal clusters where SARs with homogeneous intensities were aggregated. We showed that the IC/ha indicator displayed a broad intensity gradient where production types were fairly evenly distributed. Multinomial regression models provided a reliable estimate of the intensity indicator (mean cross-validation error = 23\%, mean r2 = 0.7) with SAR resolution. At the scale of France and within the two intensity extremes ({\textless}300 D /ha and {\textgreater}500 D /ha), SARs were signiﬁcantly aggregated in several clusters. Most low-input SARs were aggregated into a large cluster ranging across several mountainous regions. Less high-input SARs were signiﬁcantly aggregated. Our results could be used for infra-regional targeting of conservation policies.},

	abstract = {Regional distinctiveness is supported by the European Union in rural development policy. However, there is little information about the spatial distribution of the potential for rural development across Europe. The concept of territorial capital is used to consider spatial characteristics in assessing the capacity for rural development. Expert-based descriptions of territorial capital are translated into mappable proxies to locate regions with development capacities in intensive agriculture, off-farm employment, rural tourism and conservation. Combining these potentials, the capacity for multiple functions within regions is assessed. A partial validation of the expert-based weighing of territorial capital is done by comparison with an empirical approach based on logistic regression. The results indicate strong variation between regions in rural development potentials. In Western Europe, regions with high rural tourism probability also share a high potential for conservation while opportunities for intensive agriculture and off-farm employment are generally low. In other parts of Europe these correlations are less pronounced. Several regions offer limited potential in all four considered functions while few regions have potential in all four functions. The assessment provides policymakers with assistance in identifying competitive rural development projects. Targeting rural development policies to high potential areas may increase policy efficiency.},

	abstract = {Within the debate about rural development policy (RDP), there has been increasing call for a stronger territorial focus emphasising the potentials, resources and demands of regions. Investments in territorial capital and regional capacity building have been considered as the two main cornerstones of a place-based approach to rural development (OECD, 2006). On the basis of an analytical literature review, we developed a framework to operationalise a place-based approach of RDP. In the proposed framework, the two cornerstones are further subdivided into six topics: “territorial capital” is broken down into physical, human, natural capital, while “capacity building” encompasses modernisation, restructuring and stabilisation of existing territorial assets. Regional RDP expenditure data for the years 2007 to 2011 are used to test the empirical validity of the framework, explore the regional implementation patterns of RD measures and their spatial distribution across European regions. A cluster analysis was applied to identify groups of EU regions with similar settings of RD priorities. In more than half of the regions either natural capital investments or stabilisation represent the dominant priority. Other regions make broader use of rural development topics and are able to combine different ones in their programme designs. The spatial heterogeneity observed in expenditures allocated to the different rural development topics is interpreted as evidence of the place-based character of the EU RD policy. The intervention of various authorities in the programming of RD policy (EU, Member State and regional), as well as the fact that spending ultimately depends on the voluntary uptake of the measures by individual rural actors are discussed as the important factors explaining this heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {The EU offers a complex system of rural development interventions as part of its Common Agricultural Policy. A Common Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (CMEF) has been developed for the programming period 2007–2013 in response to challenges faced with the evaluation of rural development measures in earlier programming periods. Statistical and multivariate analysis of CMEF baseline (regional characteristics) and input (expenditure) indicator data at the NUTS2 subdivision level is used to compare four typical expenditure allocation patterns (Competitiveness, Environment, Rural Viability, Equal Spending) in terms of associated regional characteristics and development trends. The results suggest expenditure priorities are generally in line with regional needs and that there are some positive development trends, for example higher increase of agricultural labour productivity in the Competitiveness Group, while for environmental topics the level of data required remains unsatisfactory for trend assessment. 17\% of the regions have a budget allocation pattern deviating from other regions with similar characteristics, which could indicate ineffective priority setting. Consistent CMEF data over multiple programming periods would be desirable to support the relationships found and to facilitate time series analysis, but this seems questionable given that the European Commission has discontinued the CMEF in 2014 with further adaptations for the 2014–2020 programming period underway.},

To address the clear spatial patterns in the distribution of agricultural labour productivity, we employ regression models in which spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence are explicitly modelled to quantify the impact of RDPs.},

Pierre Dupraz, an expert in economic evaluations of agri-environment schemes, pointed out past issues of agri-environment schemes including the conflicting objectives and the growing complexity. James Moran, an ecologist who has been involved in the design of results-based schemes, identified the importance of designing schemes that are adaptable and incentivise farmers to improve. Ronan O'Flaherty, a senior policymaker involved in new scheme design in Ireland, shone a light on the policy behind agri-environment schemes and the importance of stakeholder buy-in. Pat Murphy, a knowledge transfer specialist involved in the implementation of agri-environment schemes, discussed the importance that knowledge transfer must play in the future of agri-environment schemes. Together the speakers identified the challenges faced in designing and implementing agri-environment schemes that improve environmental outcomes whether they be action or results-based.},

This puzzling result can be attributed to increased awareness of administrative burden associated with RDP participation. An additional heterogeneity analysis suggests the negative effect is driven by unprofitable farmers who are averse to any administrative encumbrance, for whom upfront cofinancing of an RDP is untenable.},

Yet, field sizes are not adequately considered in many theoretical landscape-oriented modelling approaches explaining habitats as well as biodiversity (BD). Our objective is to transfer theoretical model thinking into a practical approach with the focus on field and farm size changes. In our novel approach we model the impact of land consolidation driven by structural change, exchange of land between neighboring farmers and the participation in agri-environmental scemes. We work with a spatial representation of farming decisions and apply our model to a regional case study characterized as an intensively used agricultural area in Germany. Results are graphically translated via a geographical information system (GIS) and indicate that structural change leads to landscape homogeneity in our study region, and diversity of farming shrinks under the Common Agricultural Policy Reform 2009. Our model gives an idea of spatial variation in crop heterogeneity over time by conceptualizing spatial and temporal scales. In our stylized landscape visualization we prove the capabilities of a bio-economic modelling approach capturing economic resource allocation patterns and spatial representation of farming decisions in a perspective of sustainability analysis.},

	abstract = {In the European Union (EU), the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has an ambivalent legacy, in that agricultural production is distorted in favor of the EU economy which has had a direct impact on a broader scale on land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF) outside of the EU. The absence of tariffs for animal feed has evolved to a situation where the EU cheaply imports animal feed from Latin America, including soybeans that are among the main causes of deforestation in the Amazon and the Cerrado region. On the other hand, there is a huge potential for mitigating climate change by reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+). This article focuses on one aspect—soy and REDD+ and attempts to make a modest contribution to policy debates by showing that REDD+ and agriculture are closely linked. The 2013 reforms (or lack thereof) of CAP may well have far-reaching impacts on the multifaceted and already complex landscape under which REDD+ will operate, to the extent that it may be in danger of derailing the mechanism in its infancy.},

Integration has been pursued through the attachment of environmental conditions to the receipt of direct payments in Pillar 1 (cross compliance) and the use of voluntary agri-environment measures in Pillar 2. In formulating its proposals for the revision of the CAP post-2013, the Commission opted to pursue further integration largely through Pillar 1 through the introduction of a ‘green’ payment for farmers following a specified set of mandatory farm practices. The legislative process was not concluded in February 2013, but enough is known of the positions of the Council and the European Parliament to indicate that the level of greening ambition in this CAP reform will be very limited. Some explanations for the apparent failure to significantly reshape the CAP to tackle the problems faced by the natural environment are reviewed. It is suggested that, far from being complementary, cross compliance and voluntary agri-environment measures are competing approaches to further greening of the CAP. Advocates of a greater focus on environmental objectives need to choose between these approaches.},

Amongst the productive factors, land is the one that most often limits farm development. This paper seeks to identify determinants of intended changes in farm size (represented by farmed area and measured as a reduction, expansion or no change) identified as stated intentions expressed through survey information, under two different Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) scenarios: (1) the Baseline, characterised by the Health Check policy as of 2009; and (2) a No-CAP scenario, assuming the elimination of all CAP payments and regulatory measures. Results highlight that CAP abolishment strongly reduces the intention to increase the amount of farmed area; the determinants of change in farmed area also change sharply amongst the two scenarios. Geographic variables, and farm characteristics such as farm organisation and the number of on-farm employees are relevant to explain the farmed area expansion. On the contrary, without the CAP, the relation between household and farm has strong effects on the different directions of change of farmed area. The results confirm that the different single payments scheme models affect the changes in demand of land.},

While the CSA concept encompasses three pillars (productivity, adaptation, and mitigation), the literature has hardly addressed them in an integrated way. The development status of study sites also seems to inﬂuence which pillars are promoted. Mitigation was predominantly addressed in high-income countries, while productivity and adaptation were priorities for middle and low-income countries. Interest in institutional aspects has been gradual in the CSA literature. It has largely focused on knowledge infrastructure, market structure, and hard institutional aspects. There has been less attention to understand whether investments in physical infrastructure and actors’ interaction, or how historical, political, and social context may inﬂuence the uptake of CSA options. Rethinking the approach to promoting CSA technologies by integrating technology packages and institutional enabling factors can provide potential opportunities for effective scaling of CSA options.},

For this purpose, we conducted a structured literature review in combination with a cluster analysis in order to (1) identify the overall ideas and aspects associated with sustainable agriculture; (2) detect patterns and differences in how these ideas and aspects are adopted or applied; (3) evaluate how the different ideas and aspects of sustainable agriculture are combined in the scientific debate, and assess whether these different conceptions match with those that have been claimed to exist in the debate. There are two valuable outcomes from this research. The first is a framework for understanding the components of sustainable agriculture. The second outcome is in highlighting ways for actors involved with sustainable agriculture to deal with the complexity and multiplicity of this concept in a constructive manner.},

	abstract = {After two decades of research on sustainable intensification (SI), namely securing food production on less environmental cost, heterogeneous understandings and perspectives prevail in a broad and partly fragmented scientific literature. Structuring and consolidating contributions to provide practice-oriented guidelines are lacking. The objectives of this study are to (1) comprehensively explore the academic SI literature, (2) propose an implementation-oriented conceptual framework, and (3) demonstrate its applicability for region-specific problem settings. In a systematic literature review of 349 papers covering the international literature of 20 years of SI research, we identified SI practices and analysed temporal, spatial and disciplinary trends and foci. Based on key SI practices, a conceptual framework was developed differentiating four fields of action from farm to regional and landscape scale and from land use to structural optimisation. Its applicability to derive region-specific SI solutions was successfully tested through stakeholder processes in four European case studies. Disciplinary boundaries and the separation of the temporal and spatial strands in the literature prevent a holistic address of SI. This leads to the dominance of research describing SI practices in isolation, mainly on the farm scale. Coordinated actions on the regional scale and the coupling of multiple practices are comparatively underrepresented. Results from the case studies demonstrate that implementation is extremely context-sensitive and thus crucially depends on the situational knowledge of farmers and stakeholders. Although, there is no ‘one size fits all’ solution, practitioners in all regions identified the need for integrated solutions and common action to implement suitable SI strategies at the regional landscape level and in local ecosystems.},

In this article, we overview the methodology of systematic reviews and provide a discussion of their use. Systematic reviews differ qualitatively from traditional reviews by explicitly deﬁning a speciﬁc review question, employing methods to reduce bias in the selection and inclusion of studies that address the review question (including a systematic and speciﬁed search strategy, and selection of studies based on explicit eligibility criteria), an assessment of the risk of bias for included studies and objectively summarizing the results qualitatively or quantitatively (i.e. via meta-analysis). Systematic reviews have been widely used to address human healthcare questions and are increasingly being used in veterinary medicine. Systematic reviews can provide veterinarians and other decision-makers with a scientiﬁcally defensible summary of the current state of knowledge on a topic without the need for the end-user to read the vast amount of primary research related to that topic.},

	abstract = {Objectives This review aimed to quantify suicide risk among agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers and study potential variations of risk within this population.
Methods We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis from 1995 to 2016 using MEDLINE and following the PRISMA guidelines. A pooled effect size of suicide risk among the population of interest was calculated using meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted to investigate whether effect size differed according to population or study characteristics. Meta-regression was used to identify sources of heterogeneity.
Results The systematic review identified 65 studies, of which 32 were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled effect size was 1.48 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.30–1.68] representing an excess of suicide risk among the population of interest. Subgroup analysis showed that this effect size varied according to geographic area, with a higher effect size in Japan. The following study characteristics were found to contribute to the between-study variance: reference group, measure of effect size, and study design.
Conclusions Our findings suggest an excess of suicide risk among agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers and demonstrated that this excess may be even higher for these groups in Japan. This review highlights the need for suicide prevention policies focusing on this specific population of workers. More research is also needed to better understand the underlying factors that may increase suicide risk in this population.},

Accordingly, our research questions deal with the definition of the main conceptual dimensions developed by the academic literature on PFP as well as with the geographical and temporal differences among the dimensions identified. The first evidence is the increase in the number of papers per year during the last decade. Furthermore, the literature on PFP is centred on the concepts of localisation and structured demand and its impacts on food chain actors, on citizen-consumers and on sustainability at large. As a main research result, we provide a conceptual framework of the PFP literature largely based on the concept of linkage that has been first proposed in law and regulation studies.},

How organic farmers are distributed worldwide, however, remains unknown. Using publicly accessible registries of organic crop farmers we mapped their distribution globally and related it to local socio-economic, climatic, and soil characteristics. We show that organic crop farmers are mostly present in areas with favorable socio-economic and climatic conditions, both globally but also within countries. Within developed countries, the locations of organic crop farmers often do not differ significantly from the locations of conventional crop farmers. In developing countries, there are, however, larger differences and organic crop farmers concentrate in the more accessible and developed regions. Our results suggest that crop farmers in poor areas may not have sufficient access to certification and markets. To promote the spread of organic farming, certification and other incentives could target farmers in areas with lower market access and higher levels of poverty which could improve value chains for organic products in these areas.},

Based on this review and the use of computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software, the 129 identified and investigated literature sources were divided into four sections: carbon accounting at the national scale, at the project scale, at the organizational scale and at the product scale. Additionally, at each scale, we differentiated between non-monetary and monetary aspects and explained the purpose of the study. Based on these findings, a definition of carbon accounting is proposed that can be used by academics to operationalize their research questions, by legislators to delimit obligatory and voluntary accounting and by practitioners to establish carbon accounting in companies.},

Currently, many EU rural areas are experiencing major transformations and the traditional urban-rural divide seems outdated (OECD, 2006). Going beyond dichotomous definitions and approaches, the paper applies at EU NUTS 3 level a new composite and comprehensive measure of rurality and peripherality (the PeripheRurality Indicator, PRI): the higher this index, the more rural and peripheral a given region is. Within a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) approach, this indicator takes into account both conventional socio-economic indicators and the relevant geographical characteristics of the region. On the basis of this analysis, the paper also puts forward a clusterisation of NUTS 3 regions across Europe and assesses the correlation between the RDP expenditure intensity, the PRI and the different regional clusters. This analysis is aimed at assessing the coherence of RDP fund allocation with the real characteristics of EU rural space.},

The clarity and transparency of these reports, however, is not optimal. Poor reporting of systematic reviews diminishes their value to clinicians, policy makers, and other users. Since the development of the QUOROM (QUality Of Reporting Of Meta-analysis) Statement—a reporting guideline published in 1999—there have been several conceptual, methodological, and practical advances regarding the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Also, reviews of published systematic reviews have found that key information about these studies is often poorly reported. Realizing these issues, an international group that included experienced authors and methodologists developed PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) as an evolution of the original QUOROM guideline for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of evaluations of health care interventions. The PRISMA Statement consists of a 27-item checklist and a four-phase flow diagram. The checklist includes items deemed essential for transparent reporting of a systematic review. In this Explanation and Elaboration document, we explain the meaning and rationale for each checklist item. For each item, we include an example of good reporting and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies and methodological literature. The PRISMA Statement, this document, and the associated Web site (http://www. prisma-statement.org/) should be helpful resources to improve reporting of systematic reviews and metaanalyses.},

One type of bias, known as “p-hacking,” occurs when researchers collect or select data or statistical analyses until nonsignificant results become significant. Here, we use text-mining to demonstrate that p-hacking is widespread throughout science. We then illustrate how one can test for p-hacking when performing a meta-analysis and show that, while p-hacking is probably common, its effect seems to be weak relative to the real effect sizes being measured. This result suggests that p-hacking probably does not drastically alter scientific consensuses drawn from meta-analyses.},

	abstract = {European rural landscapes are in transition due to macro changes in climate, agriculture and public policy, combined with various forms of urbanisation. These changes are affecting the resource basis of agriculture, the socio-cultural identity of rural communities, and are challenging the policy regimes affecting European landscapes. Therefore, they demand new forms of landscape governance if the diversity and quality of the landscapes are to be protected and further developed in the future. New analytical tools supported by revised conceptual frameworks are needed to assist identification and assessment of future development options. This article is based on a book published earlier this year. It presents and discusses the current patterns of change and their implications for policy. Three major policy challenges are identified: integration of agricultural and environmental policies; pro-active approaches to landscape change to cope with non-agricultural demands including recreation and nature conservation; and stakeholder involvement in policy design and implementation including farmers and other primary managers, public agencies at all levels and local communities in various forms. Key points are illustrated in a case study involving the development of a landscape strategy in the Karby parish in northwest Denmark.},

The diversification of on-farm activities may depend on socioeconomic and environmental characteristics. Although multifunctionality is a hotly debated topic, few papers have focused on the farm characteristics that influence diversification and none have focused on the influence of the spatial pattern. This paper examines the relationship between farm characteristics and the adoption of a specific type of diversification. An econometric model is presented that uses a spatial autoregressive lag model at the municipal scale. The results demonstrate that the activation of each diversification dimension is influenced by both internal and external factors, encompassing farmers’ characteristics, the farm structure, and territorial features, including regional and spatial patterns. Deepening is mainly influenced by the farmer’s age, education, and the presence of small and labor-intensive farms. The key factors for broadening diversification are the presence of small farms and farms with mixed production (breeding and crop cultivation). Regrounding is most affected by the labor-intensive farms in the area and the farms with mixed production.},

We find that, on average, EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) subsidies increase agricultural labor productivity growth, but this aggregate effect hides important heterogeneity of effects of different types of subsidies. The positive effect on productivity comes from decoupled subsidies, that is, Pillar I decoupled payments and some Pillar II payments. Coupled Pillar I subsidies have the opposite effect: they slow down productivity growth.},

This is particularly true in the agricultural space for which household and farm surveys will be critical both to collect primary data as well as to validate alternative data sources. Recent methodological gains and technological innovations offer a unique opportunity to address many of the shortcomings of agricultural data. In this article, we briefly describe select examples of such methodological and technological changes, drawing from the Living Standards Measurement Study-Integrated Surveys on Agriculture, a survey program aimed at improving the availability, quality, and relevance of agricultural data in multitopic, multipurpose household surveys.},

	abstract = {Methods to construct farm household typologies may differ in their approach but they share a common feature: they rely mostly on structural farm data. Methods to build functional typologies are far less abundant. Households or communities are complex social-ecological systems that often exhibit patterns in their response to disturbances (e.g., droughts, floods, price shocks, policy change). We propose building functional typologies –classifiable ´behaviours´ of rural actors – using archetype analysis to categorise such responses and identify salient behaviours. We illustrate this approach by examining the response of rural households to recurrent droughts in northern Patagonia, Argentina, as revealed by 23 in-depth interviews about perceptions and strategies concerning droughts. Using the algorithm from Mørup and Hansen (2012), and the corrected Akaike decision rule, we identified three archetypes (A–C) that represented three distinct aggregated responses of households to droughts. Archetype A presented variable degrees of resistance to droughts (production losses {\textless} 40\%), avoidance and diversification, whereas archetype B exhibited tolerance (higher losses) and some degree of transformability (off-farm income). Archetype C farms exhibited high levels of vulnerability, if some degree of tolerance to high losses, but no real adaptive strategy to speak of. Such pattern could not have been identified through the more commonly used typology building methods such as using multivariate and clustering techniques. By allowing to combine qualitative and quantitative information, and to deal with a relatively small number of observations, archetype analysis appears as highly suitable to delineate functional farm household typologies.},

The article performs a theory-based evaluation using the method of realist synthesis to investigate the two measures, test their implicit assumptions, and provide a more complete picture of how the policy works. The results highlight the marginal importance of bureaucratic procedures in the cost structure of donations, the diverse responses of different donors and food rescue organisations, and the importance of considering the capacity and preferences of charities when an increase in donations is expected. Further, the analysis uncovers severe reputational risks that limit both the supply of and demand for food past the BBD, despite legal provisions promoting its donation.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the impact of broadband access on agribusiness in rural Wales and the resulting implications on entrepreneurial activity. Despite attempts by Government and telecommunications providers to develop widespread broadband coverage in Wales, concerns remain in relation to an increasing digital divide between urban and rural locations. Broadband is a key enabling technology therefore connectivity is significant, not only in communication, but also in the ability for businesses to innovate and grow. Wales is a predominantly rural country with 84\% of the total land area in Wales being used for agriculture (Welsh Government, 2013). The food and farming sector represents a significant part of the Welsh economy, and is dominated by small businesses. Connectivity and increased use of technology are vital for these businesses to overcome location constraints and various industrial challenges, notably Brexit. The research uses survey data from 738 farmers and 107 food SMEs in Wales, with 19 follow-up semi-structured interviews. The survey results highlight issues of technology adoption, with 19\% of farmers in the survey having no access to broadband internet, with others reporting the speed of connection being a limiting factor. The consequences of poor connectivity point to limited computer skills and low levels of soft technology adoption, a lack of engagement with social media, limited scope for innovation and restricted business growth, with 55.1\% of food respondents identifying poor broadband access as a barrier to internationalisation. This has led to agrifood businesses adopting a passive approach to growth opportunities. The findings suggest that rural areas remain at a disadvantage due to poor connectivity, an issue that must be tackled by the Welsh Government to readdress the balance in the economy and limit a brain drain of skilled people moving to urban areas, often outside Wales. Support for such businesses is vital, particularly given the pressures and uncertainty in the industry, as broadband access represents an important enabler for future innovation and entrepreneurial activity.},

In this paper, we explore entrepreneurial exaptation as a mechanism for creating regional development in rural regions characterised by organisational thinness. Exaptation as a source of innovation involves the adoption of one or more resources for a different purpose than it was originally intended or designed for. Using a longitudinal field study of a region in rural Sweden and a garden-themed new venture based on the exaptation of local resources, we show how exaptation can initiate a positive development path in a hitherto lagging rural region. Through collective agency, involving entrepreneurs and locals, the exaptation creates an epistemological displacement that discloses concrete and abstract affordances in local resources. Overall, our study points to the importance of entrepreneurial exaptation as a source of innovation in rural regions and suggests that regional development paths are not determined by lock-in effects and path dependencies related to existing resource bases.},

Yet, research mostly focuses on cluster economic performance, but less on regional social cohesion, which is important when economic growth coexists with deprivation, poverty and inequality. The paper’s aim is to understand both the economic and the social dynamics of clusters by developing a theoretical model based on system dynamics. It shows that clusters with positive economic performance do not necessarily lead to regional social cohesion. Multiple positive economic-related feedback processes can be mitigated by negative social-related feedback processes. Implications for academics and policy-makers are proposed.},

This paper maps the geography of EU discontent across more than 63,000 electoral districts in the EU-28 and assesses which factors push anti-EU voting. The results show that the anti-EU vote is mainly a consequence of local economic and industrial decline in combination with lower employment and a less educated workforce. Many of the other suggested causes of discontent, by contrast, matter less than expected, or their impact varies depending on levels of opposition to European integration.},

To that aim, it ﬁrst develops a theoretical model of cost efﬁciency that takes into account spatial interactions and spillover effects among neighbouring jurisdictions. The model solution leads to a spatial Durbin panel data speciﬁcation of local spending as a non-linear function of population size. The model is tested using a large local data set over the period 2003–11 for an aggregate measure of public spending. The empirical ﬁndings suggest a ‘U’-shaped relationship between population size and the costs of providing public services. A second step investigates the role of geographical characteristics such as elevation and terrain ruggedness in the determination of the optimal jurisdiction size. The results reveal that optimal city size decreases with elevation and increases with ruggedness.},

The issue of rural areas has become an important part of the CAP measures in Pillar 2. Since the CAP does not have a primarily territorial orientation, it does not contribute to territorial cohesion of rural areas. In a similar vein, regional policy, which is primarily oriented towards territorial development, also failed to give rise to complete, balanced development. Using qualitative analysis, this article summarises references selected on the basis of the authors’ experience in policy issues. The types of discourse included on the subject of coherence of common policies are the role of agricultural, rural and regional policy in cohesion and the conflict of cohesion and competitiveness objectives. Modern political and economic efforts of converging competitiveness into the macro concept with spatial implication result in planning and implementation of inappropriate measures and instruments intended to encourage the balanced territorial development of the EU. From this arises a conflict of cohesion and competitiveness, coupled with long-term consequences for the most vulnerable areas.},

	abstract = {Farm diversification has been widely regarded as a panacea for improving the rural economy within the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). However, the CAP provides less support for the entrepreneurial behavior that farmers need to exhibit to make diversification successful. Previous studies have identified the capabilities and preferences of farmers as determinants of diversification. Although, the complex relationship between these factors and diversification decisions is not well understood. Using data from a survey of 182 farms located close to urban areas in the UK, this paper reports on one of the first studies to quantitatively explore farm diversification through identifying the impact of the entrepreneurial behavior of farmers and the role of family businesses. Using structural equation models, the results suggest that farmers’ marketing capabilities mediate the positive influence that entrepreneurial ability has on diversification. Moreover, while preferences for maintaining the farm as a family business have a negative effect on entrepreneurship and diversification, a desire for the family business to make a social contribution has a more positive impact. These findings have significant implications for EU rural development policies and for the future development of rural policies in the UK in light of its impending departure from the EU. © 2019, © 2019 Journal of the Canadian Council for Small Business and Entrepreneurship/Conseil de la PME et de l’entrepreneuriat.},

We investigate 1) to what extent evaluations have influenced the design of national programmes and 2) if they have affected the Rural Development Regulation on which national programmes are based. Our main finding is that evaluations do not seem to affect future policy to any discernible degree. This is the case for both national programmes and the Regulation itself, which seems to have evolved in response to external pressures. Partly, this may be because evaluations tend to give vague or too general recommendations. Moreover, evaluations seldom apply counterfactual analysis, often because of a lack of data, implying that results may be methodologically questioned. Lastly, evaluations, and RDPs, are hard to locate and seldom translated from their native languages, impairing the possibilities of learning from the experiences of others.},

	abstract = {The field activities within the regional post-harvest loss assessment programme in small-scale fisheries in Africa (an FAO regular programme conducted from 2006 to 2008) tested and validated three key fish loss assessment methodologies that have been developed over the past two decades: the Informal Fish Loss Assessment Method (IFLAM), Load Tracking (LT) and the Questionnaire Loss Assessment Method (QLAM). This manual describes these three methods in detail and provides practical guidelines on when they can be used and on how to use them to collect reliable data, be it for planning for an intervention to reduce losses in a particular area or at the country level or monitoring and assessing the effectiveness of a loss reduction intervention. While the IFLAM is used to generate qualitative and indicative quantitative post-harvest fish loss data that can be used to inform decision-making or to plan the use of LT and the QLAM, the latter are quantitative assessment methods. Load Tracking is used to quantify losses at stages along the distribution chain or losses related to specific activities, such as fishing, transport, processing and marketing. Key data related to the cause and effects of losses from an IFLAM study are validated using the QLAM before any suitable intervention is introduced. A combination of the IFLAM, LT and QLAM could then be used to monitor and evaluate the effects of an intervention. Illustrative examples and case studies are presented to facilitate the uptake and use of the methods in systematic fish loss assessment. This fieldwork tool also enlightens the extension officer on how to communicate the data from the assessments and the design of loss reduction interventions to help policy-planners and decision-makers understand important issues facing fishing communities. It is hoped that this manual will be of interest to all those involved in fisheries technology and development, field research, data analysis and reporting as well as participatory approaches to development},

	abstract = {Global food demand is driven by population and economic growth, and urbanization. One important instrument to meet this increasing demand and to decrease the pressure on food production is to minimize food losses and food waste. Food waste and loss is a major societal, economic, nutritional and environmental challenge. Using the case of Denmark, this paper analyses causes of food waste, and discusses how different stakeholders address the prevention and reuse of the €1.18 billion of annual edible food waste. Currently, the majority of food waste is still incinerated with energy recovery. However, improvements in technology have made it more efﬁcient to utilize food waste for biogas and compost, which improves nutrient cycling through the food system. Major efforts to address food waste in Denmark have mainly been promoted through civil society groups with governmental support, as well as by industry. In order to better understand food waste and loss more research must be conducted on the total amount of food waste at every level of the food supply chain. Solutions can be found through improved communication, more efﬁcient food packaging, and better in interpretation of food labels by consumers. Likewise, systems thinking may support an integrated agricultural and food system where food utilization is optimized and loss and waste of resources is reduced. In conclusion, sustainable solutions to the reduction of food waste in Denmark must include multi-stakeholders collaboration, especially public–private partnerships at the global level.},

	abstract = {Based on the average level of seafood consumption in the United States (U.S.), the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans encourages citizens to double their intake to improve the health of their diets. The future availability of seafood, however, is threatened by overﬁshing, unsustainable seafood farming practices, ocean pollution and acidiﬁcation, and other factors. The growing global population and advancing ecological threats such as climate change are placing increasing demands and constraints on U.S. and global seafood supplies. Waste reduction has the potential to support increased seafood consumption without further stressing aquatic resources. It is essential to quantify waste levels in order to effectively target and design waste reduction interventions. Accordingly, we used previous multi-country regional research and updated datasets to calculate a country-speciﬁc (U.S.) estimate of seafood loss for the years 2009–2013. We estimate that 40–47\% of the edible U.S. seafood supply went uneaten in this period. The greatest portions of this loss occurred at the levels of consumers (in and out of home) (51–63\% of loss attributed to consumption), bycatch discarded by commercial ﬁshers (16–32\%), and in distribution and retail operations (13–16\%). Based on conservative estimates, this waste represents 208 billion grams of protein, 1.8 trillion mg of eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids (i.e., omega-3 fatty acids), and 1.1 trillion kilocalories. The seafood that is lost could ﬁll 36\% of the gap between current consumption and U.S. Department of Agriculture-recommended levels. As another way of understanding the magnitude of loss, this lost seafood could provide the total yearly target quantity of protein for 10.1 million men or 12.4 million women, EPA + DHA for 20.1 million adults, and calories for 1.5 million adults. The lost nutrition estimates we provide are meant to be illustrative of the issue’s signiﬁcance and magnitude. While a signiﬁcant portion of the loss could be prevented or recovered for human consumption, we do not intend to suggest that all of it could or should become food for humans. Bycatch is generally best left in the water; some seafood loss is not culturally acceptable, marketable, nutritious or safe; and a portion of loss is also unavoidable. Instead, we discuss waste prevention strategies involving governments, businesses, and consumers that can be employed to reduce seafood loss and create a more efﬁcient and sustainable seafood system..},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the relationship between general consumer conﬁdence in the safety of food and consumer trust in institutions and organizations. More speciﬁcally, using a decompositional regression analysis approach, the extent to which the strength of the relationship between trust and general conﬁdence is dependent upon a particular food chain actor (for example, food manufacturers) is assessed. In addition, the impact of speciﬁc subdimensions of trust, such as openness, on consumer conﬁdence are analyzed, as well as interaction effects of actors and subdimensions of trust. The results conﬁrm previous ﬁndings, which indicate that a higher level of trust is associated with a higher level of conﬁdence. However, the results from the current study extend on previous ﬁndings by disentangling the effects that determine the strength of this relationship into speciﬁc components associated with the different actors, the different trust dimensions, and speciﬁc combinations of actors and trust dimensions. The results show that trust in food manufacturers inﬂuences general conﬁdence more than trust in other food chain actors, and that care is the most important trust dimension. However, the contribution of a particular trust dimension in enhancing general conﬁdence is actor-speciﬁc, suggesting that different actors should focus on different trust dimensions when the purpose is to enhance consumer conﬁdence in food safety. Implications for the development of communication strategies that are designed to regain or maintain consumer conﬁdence in the safety of food are discussed.},

As food chains become globalized, risk management and communication are increasingly applied at international levels. As a consequence, cross-culturally valid theoretical models are needed to investigate consumer confidence in the safety of food. In this study, consumer confidence in the safety of food in Canada and the Netherlands was systematically compared. On the basis of two nationally representative samples, it was examined to what extent differences in consumer confidence between the two countries resulted from differences in the relative importance of the determinants of confidence, and differences in the means of the constructs. No differences between Canada and the Netherlands were found regarding the relative importance of the determinants, which provides support for the generalizability of the framework. However, results indicated that Dutch consumers had a higher level of optimism and a lower level of pessimism regarding the safety of food, which appeared to be mainly related to Dutch consumers’ lower level of concern about factors related to production. The results also indicated cross-national differences in consumer recall of food safety issues in the media.},

This paper studies the relationship between perceived trust and day-to-day purchase behavior for meat, giving special attention to the degree of meat processing. Controlling for trust in food chain actors and demographic and socio-economic variables, actual meat purchases of Canadian households are linked to answers from a commissioned food attitudes survey completed by the same households. Expenditures for processed and total meat (but not for fresh meat) are significantly different by three levels of trust in the food industry. Consumer with the lowest trust levels consume less (especially of processed meat) compared to those with higher trust levels. However, in a multivariate setting, trust shows no effect on fresh or processed meat purchases with or without demographic and socio-economic control variables, suggesting that the impact of trust on meat purchases is only small. However, the low trusting consumer segment could potentially be a target for marketing strategies focused on reputation and quality to increase sales in this particular group.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Food security can beneﬁt from the technology’s transparency, relatively low transaction costs and instantaneous applications. A blockchain is a distributed database of records in the form of encrypted blocks, or a public ledger of all transactions or digital events that have been executed and shared among participating parties and can be veriﬁed at any time in the future. Generally, the robust and decentralized functionality of the blockchain is used for global ﬁnancial systems, but it can easily be expanded to contracts and operations such as tracking of the global supply chain. In the precision agriculture context, Information and Communications Technology can be further implemented with a blockchain infrastructure to enable new farm systems and e-agriculture schemes.
RESULTS: The purpose of this review is to show a panorama of the scientiﬁc studies (enriched by a terms mapping analysis) on the use of blockchain in the agri-food sector, from both an entirely computational and an applicative point of view. As evidenced by the network analysis, the reviewed studies mainly focused on software aspects (e.g. the architecture and smart contracts). However, some aspects regarding the diﬀerent blockchain knots (computers always connected to the blockchain network) having the role to store and distribute an updated copy of each block in a food supply-chain, result of crucial importance.
CONCLUSION: These technologies appear very promising and rich of great potential showing a good ﬂexibility for applications in several sectors but still immature and hard to apply due to their complexity. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry},

Secondly, evaluating possible implications of alternative scenarios about distribution of direct payments on technical efficiency. To these aims, a stochastic frontier analysis is adopted. Results indicate that direct payments produce significant effects on technical efficiency in specialized farms which received higher levels of support. However, effects are contrasting. Moreover, results show that redistribution of policy subsidies may negatively impact on technical efficiency to an extent depending upon the criterion of redistribution applied.

The aim of this location-based augmented reality application is to capture and collect virtual creatures called Pokémon, using a cell phone. Collecting Pokémon is made possible by using certain items only available in particular places, called Pokéstops, that the player has to visit in order to obtain them. Pokéstops are also very useful to players because the chances of finding Pokémon within its vicinity are higher as opposed to elsewhere. Because these Pokéstops are not randomly located, some spatial disparities have been observed by players. Our objective is to explain these spatial disparities in French cities. We focus on the French department of Loire-Atlantique and Nantes metropolis that permit use, to compare situations and determinants in urban and rural neighborhoods. Results of different spatial econometric models reveal strong disparities between neighborhoods located in the Nantes metropolis, and others. It appears that determinants of these disparities may vary according to whether an individual is located in a rural or urban area. Location of Pokéstops does not seem to be correlated with population characteristics, but rather with local amenities such as historical monuments, shops, or green spaces.},

MCI offers a more parsimonious specification for estimating models of regional farm group shares compared to the often-applied Markov approach. The MCI framework enables farm group-specific equations, which are used to account for drivers specific to certain farm groups. The MCI framework explains farm group shares at the regional level taken from the Farm Structure Survey (FSS) using socio-economic variables from the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) and other databases for the period 1989–2013. We consider eight production specialisations and two size classes at the NUTS 2 regional level. The results indicate that the past farm structure explains approximately 36 per cent of the EU farm structure variation across regions and time, followed by natural conditions (16 per cent), agricultural prices (14 per cent), macroeconomic variables (9 per cent), subsidies (7 per cent), population (6 per cent) and agricultural income (6 per cent). Further, we have run a simulation experiment where we derived elasticities of structural change with respect to time-varying variables. The structural change appears to be the most elastic with respect to income and macroeconomic variables.},

	abstract = {Knowledge transfer and innovation (KT\&I) are vital for sustainable rural development. European Rural Development Policy (RDP) has a long tradition of stimulating innovation in the rural space. In particular, in the 2007e2013 programming period, some measures have been explicitly targeted to support KT\&I in agriculture and in rural economies. This paper aims to analyse the spatial distribution of the actual expenditure for measures promoting KT\&I across the EU over the 2007e2011 period. In order to describe the main differences affecting the territorial allocation of this support, differences at rural development programming level are ﬁrstly taken into account. Then, the paper assesses “local” differences, i.e. those concerning the expenditure intensity at the NUTS 3 level. Findings point to an uneven and sometime low uptake of available opportunities. Imbalances come from both top-down political decisions and bottomup capacity to attract and spend EU funds. In contrast with RDP objectives, the remotest and the most agricultural EU regions tend to show a lower expenditure intensity for KT\&I measures.},

Its major novelty consists in using indicators and methods combining a high level of expenditure disaggregation across both regions and measures to assess the drivers of the expenditure mix at a more local level. At the adopted scale of analysis, the rurality degree of any region, the rurality of the neighbours and their respective expenditure patterns are explicitly considered. Results suggest that more rural regions spend more funds as expected, but their expenditure mix, and the share of agro-environmental payments in particular, also depends on the characteristics of the neighbouring space, thus conﬁrming the presence of spatial dependence in spending patterns and the need of its explicit consideration in any ex-post expenditure assessment.},

	abstract = {A methodologically sound systematic review is characterized by transparency, replicability, and a clear inclusion criterion. However, little attention has been paid to reporting the details of interrater reliability (IRR) when multiple coders are used to make decisions at various points in the screening and data extraction stages of a study. Prior research has mentioned the paucity of information on IRR including number of coders involved, at what stages and how IRR tests were conducted, and how disagreements were resolved. This article examines and reflects on the human factors that affect decision-making in systematic reviews via reporting on three IRR tests, conducted at three different points in the screening process, for two distinct reviews. Results of the two studies are discussed in the context of IRR and intrarater reliability in terms of the accuracy, precision, and reliability of coding behavior of multiple coders. Findings indicated that coding behavior changes both between and within individuals over time, emphasizing the importance of conducting regular and systematic IRR and intrarater reliability tests, especially when multiple coders are involved, to ensure consistency and clarity at the screening and coding stages. Implications for good practice while screening/coding for systematic reviews are discussed.},

Men and women are attentive to men’s upper body and consider higher SHRs as cues to masculinity, strength, and formidability. Moreover, while women’s shoulder width varies from one individual to another, to our knowledge no previous study has investigated perceived attractiveness and eye movement in relation to women’s SHR. Therefore, in the current study, we investigated attractiveness ratings and eye movements of both men and women to front- and back-posed male and female stimuli varying in SHR. Our results showed that men prefer more masculine ratios for men and less masculine ratios for women. However, the results also showed that women preferred an intermediate SHR for both men and women in the back view while their preference in the front view is not influenced by SHR. Eye movements showed that men viewed the chest region of other men in the front and back views of stimuli, and they had longer dwell time on chests of male stimuli with higher SHRs, while no significant difference was found for dwell time on chests of female stimuli varying in SHR. Also, no differences were observed for female participants in dwell time, for either chest regions of SHRs of male stimuli or for the chests of female stimuli. Altogether, the results of this study suggest that men more than women are attentive to variations in SHRs.},

Meta-analysis is especially useful for combining evidence to inform social policy, but meta-analyses of applied social science research may encounter practical issues arising from the nature of the research domain. The current paper identifies potential resolutions to four issues that may be encountered in systematic reviews and meta-analyses in social research. The four issues are: scoping and targeting research questions appropriate for meta-analysis; selecting eligibility criteria where primary studies vary in research design and choice of outcome measures; dealing with inconsistent reporting in primary studies; and identifying sources of heterogeneity with multiple confounded moderators. The paper presents an overview of each issue with a review of potential resolutions, identified from similar issues encountered in meta-analysis in medical and biological sciences. The discussion aims to share and improve methodology in systematic reviews and meta-analysis by promoting cross-disciplinary communication, that is, to encourage ‘viewing through different lenses’.},

	abstract = {This paper analyses the determinants of inter-regional innovation cooperation in European knowledge networks. Our main goal is to assess whether structural heterogeneity in the context of the “urban-rural dichotomy” and international borders can explain differences in the regions’ engagement in inter-regional innovation cooperation. We estimate a gravity equation to model innovation cooperation, proxied by inter-regional co-patent applications, as a function of region-specific context conditions as well as technological and geographical distance. Our data comprise dyadic information on 203 NUTS2 regions in 15 European countries (EU-15) for the year 2010. The empirical results show that the basic gravity mechanisms drive the direction and strength of innovation cooperation between EU regions; i.e., geographical distance acts as an impediment to inter-regional co-patent applications. Regarding the importance of structural heterogeneity, we find that pairs of rural regions have lower levels of innovation cooperation compared to urban regions. Similarly, border regions are generally disadvantaged compared to non-border regions in terms of the intensity of innovation cooperation. However, while the latter result points to a negative border effect, our gravity model estimates also show that pairs of border regions are more active in terms of close geographical innovation cooperation (e.g., through international cross-border cooperation), which partly compensates for the negative border effect. This finding not only holds for urban but also rural border regions and may reflect policy attempts to support border regions, e.g., by strengthening the level of international cross-border cooperation within the EU.},

	abstract = {Purpose Viewing consumer confidence as a set of static factors has informed previous research and underpinned strategies used in recovering from food safety quality failures, but this approach has not delivered reliable and quick recovery from large-scale food safety scandals. The purpose of this paper is to examine extant models and the factors they are composed of, and suggest an extended model that has a better potential for consumer confidence. The paper focuses on food products where supply chains are visible, and use these features to group the findings. Design/methodology/approach In this study principal components and logit analyses are used to assess the role of 30 variables operating in a consumer confidence model constructed from several existing in the literature. This combined model considers emotional, cognitive, trust and sociodemographic factors. In total, 14 independent factors are identified. The authors examine the factors, and from these, the decision-making mechanisms before and after the Sanlu Infant Milk Formula (IMF) scandal of 2008. Findings The authors find that the factors considered by consumers are different for different IMF supply chains, and different again before and after the scandal. The authors develop the argument for an extension to the existing models, incorporating a dynamic consumer confidence system. Research limitations/implications The paper uses a single survey after the focus event to establish “before” and “after” decision-making factors. Since the IMF scandal is recent and of very high profile, this is likely valid even if it carries memory bias effects. The study is directly applicable to food safety scandals in a Chinese context. Deductive reasoning extends our assertions to a wider context. They are logically validated but have not been formally tested. Practical implications Using this system as a framework a checklist for recovery from a similar food safety scandal is suggested. The authors also suggest more general use for use where supply chains features are visible to consumers. Originality/value Models for food safety consumer confidence recovery have previously focused on identifying models and the static factors they consist of. These do represent a reflection of how this phenomenon operates, but using the principals of this model nevertheless does not result in good recovery from extreme food safety failures. This paper contributes by extending these models to one that can be applied for better recovery.},

Motivated by the need to further investigate the concept, this paper develops a conceptual framework that explores the effects of brand trust, trust in the food system, consumer confidence and brand loyalty. While most extant studies have examined the brand trust-brand loyalty link, this paper proposes that: (i) the impact of brand trust on consumer confidence in brand attributes is mediated by trust in the food system, and (ii) brand trust leads to brand loyalty via consumer confidence. The proposition is tested using Structural Equation Modelling techniques based on survey data from a sample of Canadian consumers of packaged green salad. Results indicate that in a food context, brand trust is positively associated with consumer confidence in brand quality and safety, largely via trust in the food system. Furthermore, confidence in credence attributes is shown to lead to brand loyalty. While previous research conceived brand trust as a multidimensional construct, the analysis suggests that trust in food brands could be better explained by a one-factor model.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to identify the impact of local characteristics, such as the relative concentration of economic activities, on new business location decisions based on their sectors of economic activity. Spatial establishment-level, microdata, pooled over time (2008–2014) was used for a typical Canadian nonmetropolitan area—the Lower St. Lawrence region—in the province of Quebec. The study was conducted on a radius of 1250 m to describe the local economic environment. Results of our employed multinomial logit model reveal that local characteristics influence the location decision of new individual establishments for most of the economic sectors. An econometric model is developed to simulate the probability that a new establishment (in a given economic sector) will be located at a given geographic location based on this location’s characteristics. Results confirm that the location decisions for new primary sector businesses are related to the presence of benefits arising from the existence of natural resources as well as those benefits associated with having large spaces (such as in the case of rural cities). New manufacturing sector businesses are mainly looking for a co-location (specialisation) pattern, with a slight preference to locate in small-sized cities. Finally, the location decisions of service sectors firms are strongly dependent on intermediate demand and on the distance to major markets.},

In this paper, we have presented one way of supporting the diffusion and adoption of digital innovations in rural micro-enterprises. First, we examined the challenges and digital competence of the micro-enterprises in the rural areas of Central Finland to better understand what they needed. The second step was to develop a workshop concept. Theories of innovation diffusion and adoption were used as a base for these workshops. The last step was to evaluate the developed concept, its effects and challenges. We found that the workshop concept worked well for spreading information, for encouraging a positive attitude towards digital innovations, and for planning the use of innovations. Important factors in order for this concept to work were trust, communication, and changing the roles of agents and opinion leaders.},

	abstract = {Rural territories cover 91\% of EU27 area and 56\% of population live in there. Common Agricultural Policy pays more and more attention to these territories, in particular to their development. In this work it is argued that a generic agricultural and/or socio-economic characterization might be not sufficient to understand these territories, to formulate appropriate policies and ultimately to evaluate the effectiveness of such policy measures. In our view, the “agricultural” character is closely related to the farmland natural attributes as well as to the specific farming activities while the “rural” character is more related to the functional relationships with the urban areas. Hence, a methodology is discussed to classify a geographical space based on a simple measure of urbanization and to provide a classification that considers multiple degrees of urbanization and/or rurality. The method is applied to municipality data for the Lombardy region to distinguish network-based urban systems from mono-centric cities and to classify “non-urban” territories accordingly, separating rural from peri-urban areas. Statistical tests are conducted to study the extent to which the different typologies of territories identified differ with respect to a set of agricultural characteristics. Substantial differences in agriculture are highlighted between urban and rural areas as well as among “non-urban” areas, suggesting that more rigorous definitions of rural can best used to program policies for sustainable local development.},

Taking fairness into account in public resource allocation is critically important when decision-making creates conflicts of interest among potential stakeholders. The European Union’s structural policy budget allocation is especially prone to such conflicts, mainly due to its complexity and lack of commonly accepted indexes to measure its effects. The objective of this paper is to evaluate if a fair-division algorithm can be effectively implemented in practice to diminish conflicts and provide a fair allocation of resources. The practical application involves a problem of the EU’s rural-development policy budget in Poland. The algorithm provides a simple formal framework for budget allocation and utilizes structural program evaluation questionnaires of the key stakeholder groups. The provided example demonstrates that the implementation of a fair division algorithm is feasible in practice. The algorithm is flexible, robust to variation in pre-set budget constraints, and results in a sensible solution that achieves consensus among the stakeholder groups.},

The results of the measure contribute to the restoration and reconstruction of historical monuments, churches, cemeteries and small sacral monuments which create an environment in rural settlements.

	abstract = {Governance and rural development programmes such as the European Union's LEADER programme are claimed in the policy literature to mobilise the involvement of the third sector in local development decision-making. Tracing the emergence of the third sector from the collapse of the socialist regime in the late 1980s to the aftermath of Poland's EU LEADER programme, this paper presents nation-wide data relating to the changing proﬁle of the third sector in Poland's rural areas over time. Our analysis suggests that the implementation of the Polish LEADER þ Pilot Programme (2004e2006) and the LEADER 4th Axis in Rural Development Programme (2007e2013) resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in the number of third sector organisations. Using secondary data to examine the factors attributed to this increase, we found that the ﬁnancial support offered by the LEADER programme incentivised the formal registration of third sector organisations. However, an analysis of primary data found that third sector organisations' dependence on acquiring funding constrained how they identiﬁed and achieved their own objectives. Nonetheless, we found that active involvement of the third sector in LAGs had a positive impact on the latter's engagement with local inhabitants in activities such as formulating local development strategies. We conclude that now, over a decade since the initiation of the Polish LEADER programme, the third sector has grown exponentially but its institutional character remains in ﬂux. The presence of the third sector, its resources, and its power in rural governance is patchy. A greater period of time and targeted policy supports are required for the third sector to have a more deﬁned and powerful presence in intersectoral partnerships and in rural areas more generally.},

	abstract = {Since the 1990s the LEADER approach has very powerfully addressed the spirit of mobilising actors in the countryside through focusing on endogenous potential and activating local stakeholders across all sectors. Given the long-term experience and wealth of diverse development initiatives across the European Union (EU), the diversity of implementation is huge. Considering the limited ﬁnancial support as a Community Initiative (until 2006), a signiﬁcant extension and ‘upgrading’ of LEADER was intended by integrating it into the EU Rural Development Programmes (RDPs) since 2007. The shift from the character of a ‘pilot’ instrument at the start of LEADER to its ‘mainstreaming’ into the RDPs involved radical administrative changes and high expectations of increased impacts. The interest in LEADER practice and effectiveness led to many studies that in general apply a limited perspective of self-evaluation and reﬂection on LEADER activities. Its main impact is seen in providing learning processes in rural regions and the effects on changes in local governance through extended involvement of local stakeholders and institutions. This paper provides a synthesis of European experiences and analyses of core changes, in particular by referring to the example of implementation in the Austrian context. The main lessons are based on the reﬂection of obstacles and promoting factors of implementation during the last 25 years against the LEADER principles. The limitations in the assessment of LEADER call for a systemic approach that includes interrelations to a much wider degree. LEADER’s legacy is seen well beyond a quantitative measurement, but has to be found in its inﬂuence on actors’ perspectives, new pathways and strategies for rural development1.},

This culminated in the mainstreaming of its underlying concept into the Rural Development Programmes of the current period (2007–2013), with the aim of having more effective policy implementation that considers the diversified needs of rural regions. Starting from analysis of the application and delivery of Leader under the present Rural Development Programme in two EU countries, Austria and Ireland, this paper presents an assessment of the effects of this programme change. In addition, it includes the EU-wide discussion on the (limited) effectiveness of the current implementation of Leader and the search for a reorientation towards local development activities in the EU’s reform proposals. The paper frames the analysis around the notion of social innovation, a concept of central importance to the aims of Leader. It is argued that the implementation of Leader in this period falls far behind its potential to beneficially impact rural regions; hence it should be an object of critical debate in the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and rural development measures, as well as coherence analyses with other policies, beyond 2013.},

Results show that standard drivers, such as the relative income and the relative labour share, are important determinants of out-farm migration. Overall, CAP payments signiﬁcantly contributed to maintain job in agriculture, though the magnitude of the economic effect has been quite moderate and heterogeneous across policy instruments.

	abstract = {A recursive dynamic regional Computable General Equilibrium model is developed to assess the economic impacts of two Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) scenarios in six NUTS-3 (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) (NUTS-1: major socio-economic regions, NUTS-2: basic regions for the application of regional policies, NUTS-3: small regions for speciﬁc diagnoses) regions of the European Union (EU). The main goal of the analysis is to assess the scenario effects (change in production, prices, income, employment) in the rural and urban parts of these regions as well as on the different sectors. The two scenarios analysed are related to a 30\% reduction in Pillar 1 (market measures and direct support to farmers) support and the introduction of an EUwide ﬂat rate level of Pillar 1 support complemented by a 45\% increase in Pillar 2 (Rural Development Policy) funds. Results show that the overall gross domestic product effects are not signiﬁcant, due to the relatively low importance of both the agricultural sector and CAP spending in the regional economies. However, impacts on the agricultural sector are quite important and differ according to the nature of the policy shock. Also, the structural characteristics of each case study inﬂuence the rural–urban and sectoral spillovers, including impacts on region-speciﬁc agricultural activity.},

	abstract = {Given the growing importance of cohesion policy within the European Union (EU) during the last two decades, public and scientiﬁc interest in the role of EU policies for regional disparities has risen continuously. Recent empirical studies on the impacts of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) on economic cohesion have been strikingly diverse in their principal ﬁndings. Whereas some studies suggest positive overall effects on economic cohesion, others stress exactly the opposite. One major reason for the ambiguous results is that a single agreed-upon measure of economic cohesion is lacking. We propose a concept that distinguishes between two dimensions of policy impacts on economic cohesion: (i) the redistributive impact at a deﬁned period of time and (ii) the change of the redistributive impact over time. The ﬁrst dimension addresses the question whether a policy makes the distribution of a target variable, e.g., income, more equal or unequal at one point of time. The second dimension covers the impact of the policy on the disparity of the same variable over time, i.e., the impact on convergence. An empirical illustration of the concept for 13 NUTS 1 regions in Germany over the period 1991–2009 reveals that the two policy impacts of the CAP are partly contradictory for the two dimensions. It is shown that the CAP fosters economic cohesion by reducing regional disparities in each individual year. With regard to redistributive impacts over time, we ﬁnd that CAP transfers leave income convergence largely unaffected for society as a whole. Within the agricultural sector, it leads to a convergence of receipts per farm whereas it induces a divergence of farm receipts per hectare.},

Involvement of the private sector and local inhabitants was found to be limited.

Such outline is considered as the starting point for in-depth research in the LEADER in Czechia. To achieve such goal, the paper analyses the reports about the corresponding projects published in the Leader+ Magazine (edited by Leader+ Observatory). The analysis documents that LEADER supports collaborative actions. It is obvious that the farmers mostly participate in projects aiming at adding value to local product but they are not too active in improvement of the quality of life in rural areas. It opens the room for non-farming actors for their higher participation in rural development and thus it supports the reformulation of Common Agricultural Policy.},

Since 2003, the European Union’s CAP has undergone two major reforms, the aim of which is to ensure the vitality and sustainability of rural communities. The first focuses on market-related support and direct aid to farmers for agriculture, including the Less Favoured Area Support Scheme. The second focuses on broader rural development including diversification of economic activities and stewardship for the environment. The aim of this chapter is to trace changes in rural land use and landscapes on hill sheep farms that result from the policy effect of the CAP: the dialectic evolution of the concept of rurality embedded in the European Union’s CAP and the rural landscapes shaped and used by hill sheep farmers in the Scottish borderlands.},

A hybrid, three-area Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) with three groups of households deﬁned by income level is constructed to describe interlinkages between three rural–urban localities, namely the rural area of Archanes, the less-developed, agriculturally dependent, neighbouring rural area of N. Kazantzakis, and the adjacent urban centre of Heraklion. Results are reported on the diffusion patterns of economic impacts generated by three types of CAP measure: farm income support; aids to increased agricultural productivity; aids to economic diversiﬁcation. These show that the diffusion of policy-induced economic impacts from Archanes is lower than might be expected for a small open local economy, and that beneﬁts leak primarily to Heraklion and marginally to rural N. Kazantzakis. Finally, generated income beneﬁts seem to accrue mostly in favour of high-income households, especially in the case of Guarantee subsidies.},

	abstract = {This paper attempts to examine if the Rural Development Regulation (RDR), adopted by the Commission in 1999 and hailed as the CAP's second pillar, introduces a new approach in rural development policy making, which implies the merging of rural development with regional policy. For this purpose, the application of regulations' in Greece – an Objective 1 region, with a large and structurally weak farm sector - is assessed. The adopted methodology focuses on the analysis of all instruments through which the regulation is applied, the basic one being the 2000-06 Community Support Framework (CSF), whose targets, actions and sources of financing are compared to programmes of previous periods. The efficiency of the regulation implementation is assessed on the basis of an ex-ante analysis of the current CSF and of a number of structural constraints (e.g. financial, administrative and legal) that have traditionally characterized the implementation of such programmes in Greece. Finally a brief assessment of the role that the major political agents in the agricultural policy-making can play in the promotion of the new rural policy approach is attempted. The conclusions point to the increased chances for efficient implementation of the Regulation through the introduction of the new philosophy in the Greek rural policy-making. The possible negative effects on this development due to the pressure exerted by the new members on the EU budget will probably be offset by the recent reforms proposed by the Commission for a simpler and more coherent rural development programming and management.},

In this direction, the Authors investigate the present role played by historical rural landscapes in relation to their multifaceted character and function. In recent years there has been an ever-growing appreciation of their cultural value, depending on the differential speed of environmental change (relatively high) and people’s adaptation to it (relatively slow), as a matter of compensation. Although reference is often made to the global and the European contexts, Italy is given special attention, since the long history of civilization known by its rural landscapes makes them particularly worthy of consideration and offers a wide variety of examples assuming a more general interest. The main changes occurred in the Italian rural landscapes over the last two centuries are described by referring to their main causes and to the parallel change observed in the urban-rural dialectic. The notion of “cultural landscape”, as it emerges from the international debate and documents, is applied to historic rural landscapes, according to a varied range of conditions and characteristics. Knowledge, identiﬁcation, interpretation and characterization are fundamental actions to deﬁne sustainable landscape management strategies. These last should be diversiﬁed according to landscape character, functionality, integrity and obsolescence, not being limited to outstanding landscapes only but considering all rural landscapes as heritage. To this end, heritage strategies and policies must go together with agricultural sectorial policies, since agriculture and farmers are the major actors of rural landscape protection and transformation. EU Common Agricultural Policy is considered by focusing on its effect on rural landscape and proposals coming from the heritage experts for its future implementation are examined. Emerging strategic measures and action criteria are singled out and presented. In any case, to protect historic rural landscapes, balanced change-dynamics and development vitality should be strengthened if present, introduced if not, so as to assure resilience. Neo-rurality today expresses the search for sustainable lifestyles, green development models and a better quality of life, implicitly offering new opportunities for the revitalisation of historic rural landscapes. Finally, a holistic approach and multidisciplinary cooperation are needed to allow for an effective synthesis of the many cultural visions, which today concern the theme of landscape.},

The results of the analysis indicate close interconnections and a targeting of agricultural tools on farmland and municipalities with characteristics of the supported sector. Non-agricultural tools were marginal in ﬁnancial terms and diversiﬁed with respect to their focus. The relationship of the provided subsidies with the socio-economic level of the supported municipalities was not entirely clear. The dominant part of the rural development policy was therefore not implemented in line with the objectives of the socio-economic dimension of territorial cohesion.},

	abstract = {Romanian countryside is characterized by small rural villages where a new generation of young farmers is able to deal with the out migration from the rural space by the agritourism. Since 2001 to 2015 there has been a signiﬁcant increase of farmers diversifying their production and specialization throughout the agritourism even if this typology of tourist accommodation is unfortunately centred in few Romanian counties stand out by a signiﬁcant endowment of attractions or by previous speciﬁc investments in order to implement the role and function of tourism as a stimulus of socio-economic development in Romanian rural areas. Using a quantitative approach this paper has assessed by the Social Network Analysis (SNA) the main relationships between diffusion of agritourism in Romania, speciﬁcally in 41 administrative counties, and tourism growth over 15 year time. Findings have pointed out as over the time agritourisms have arose their diffusion and rootedness in some Romanian administrative counties where arrivals and tourist accommodations are increased as a consequence of investments in human and social capital in one side and by ﬁnancial supports allocated by the European Union in the other side. Nowadays, Romanian agritourisms are able to be a good change for farmers due to a rediscover of traditional food even if one of the main bottlenecks is a poor endowment of infrastructures in some scattered rural villages.},

Within this framework, axis 3 of the EU rural development (RD) policy seeks to valorise regional assets with the aim of enhancing living standards and economic diversiﬁcation and competitiveness. The policy measures, however, are unevenly taken up across the region, and little is known about the role of territorial factors in terms of how they affect the adoption levels of the measures. To analyse the relationship between the territorial conditions and the implementation pattern, an econometric analysis was conducted within 410 municipalities inside the German Federal State of Brandenburg. Extensive grassland management, working places, exurbanisation, ecologically valuable habitats and other socio-economic factors affecting expenditure levels were identiﬁed as relevant factors for policy adoption. Here, a clear political targeting can be assumed when considering the measure of “village renewal”. It is concluded that RD policy exhibits a signiﬁcant local distinctiveness, which results from complex multi-level strategic decision-making at EU-, regional-, and individual-participant level. This, in turn, is also inﬂuenced by the local framework situation.},

	abstract = {Promotion of non-agricultural activities in Latvian rural areas is highly important for diversification of rural economy due to decrease in agricultural and forestry employment. So far too little attention has been paid to this aspect. Although EAFRD is the only EU fund directly supporting rural development, only 14\% of its public financing for projects in 2007-2013 was invested in non-agricultural entrepreneurship, half of this in financially demanding energy production projects. By total eligible accepted project expenses, approximately 60\% of rural entrepreneurship projects were financed by EAFRD. ERDF was also important in which a smaller number of higher value investment projects was implemented. Although EU funds have some importance in activating rural entrepreneurship, so far the direct impact on creation of jobs and value added has been small. The impact could be increased by setting forth specific job creation requirements for the beneficiaries. It is also suggested to avoid supporting expensive projects which do not create a substantial number of jobs. In view of rural entrepreneurs improvements in entrepreneurial environment, including taxing policy are more important than direct support. It especially concerns operation of small companies. Development of small companies in rural areas is of high importance because in many territories there is no capacity and rationale to develop large projects.},

The Rural Development Plans (RDPs) of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in European Union (EU) are the policy instruments that affect agriculture and the people living in rural areas. The RDP measure “Setting up Young Farmers” aims to ﬁght the demographic problems of these areas. This study is an attempt to highlight the role and the impacts of RDPs and especially of the “Setting up Young Farmers” measure in the prefecture of Thessaloniki in Greece. To this end, a multicriteria mathematical programming model was implemented. This methodology was chosen using the Knowledge Brokerage Approach in the context of the LIAISE project, which proposes a set of support modules that are linked to the impact assessment process with a ﬁnal goal to support future policies and design. The results showed that the “Setting up young farmers” measure achieved its goals to transfer land to young, trained farmers, to offset the set-up costs faced by young people when establishing themselves in farming.},

	abstract = {Many Italian regions have allocated through Rural Development Plans subsides to farmers to improve the level of agroforestation with the aim to reduce rural depopulation, getting better farmer’s income, and also to protect environment. Some quantitative studies have pointed out the role, function of public grants, and subsides to implement rural development by afforestation, supported by European Union funds, solving many social issues tightly linked to marginalization in rural territories. The purpose of this paper has been, using a multiple regression model, to investigate in all Italian regions if during the time 2000-2006 and over the following seven year period 2007-2013 there have been some relationships among independent variables such as afforestated surface, workforce in the primary sector and public funds allocated by the European Union about agroforestation and the dependent variable income of farmers. The main results over the first time of investigation have demonstrated as agroforestation in rural areas is pivotal to get better the living condition in the countryside and it has underlined the fundamental function of public funds to guarantee a fair rural development, reducing rural depopulation and increasing the production of positive externalities. During the second part of the analysis on Italian Rural Development Plans, the drop in funds and subsides allocated by the second pillar of the Common Agricultural Policy has brought about some effects on rural development. The second stage of this paper has analyzed in 2000 and 2012 the productive efficiency using an output-oriented function able to maximize the output in terms of farmers’ income combining different level of input. For the next time 20142020, it is pivotal to implement agro-environment measures able to improve the agroforestation and multifunctionality reducing the marginalization of rural space and the depopulation in the countryside and getting better the efficiency of allocated funds about agroforestation.},

The numbers of farm households opting to exit from agriculture increases sharply under the scenario characterised by the removal of the CAP. The statistically signiﬁcant determinants are mostly consistent with previous studies, but show different behaviour when comparing the exit decision with the willingness to sell the farm. The outcomes of this study seem to deliver a clear policy message reinforcing the notion that the current CAP payments are important for staying in/exiting farming activities, but the land reallocation process clearly requires more targeted instruments. At the same time, greater attention should be paid to mechanisms of land rent or alternative land tenure solutions.},

	abstract = {The evolution of the agricultural sector requires a permanent combination of activities related to raising the competitiveness of farms, improving the quality of life of the rural population and maintaining natural resources. Such tasks in EU countries are performed by rural development programmes (RDP), created under the second pillar of the Common Agricultural Policy. The aim of the paper is to define the role of RDPs in driving the transformation of the agricultural sector in selected countries of East-Central Europe – the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Romania – for the years 2007-2013. The authors attempt to find certain interrelationships between the premises of rural development programmes and the funds directed their way, and changes in the agricultural sector for each of the economies. The work uses critical analysis of subject literature, meta-analysis, deductive and inductive reasoning, as well as a comparative analysis using elements of time series analysis (analysis of dynamics and structure changes). The main conclusion is that: 1. the second pillar of CAP was undoubtedly an important element of support for rural areas in the countries of East-Central Europe; 2. the accumulated effects of the support led to a considerable improvement in the income situation of agricultural producers; 3. investment expenditures led to structural changes at farm level. In relation to the above, the key issue is to keep a relatively high level of funding for the second pillar of CAP for EU-12 countries after 2020.},

Respecting different path dependencies of the EU states, the article demonstrates the differences in the implementation of this method in two basic territorial units of the EU member states according to the length of the EU membership, as well as the length of experience in implementation of the LEADER method. The scope of LEADER implementation and the potential impact significantly differed between the old and new member states, and the internal heterogeneity of groups is also evident. On the one hand, lack of embeddedness of the method is manifested among the EU12 states (the need for dynamic growth of institutional capacity), on the other hand, socio-economic and political factors modify scope, potential impact and way of implementation of the method in individual countries.},

We use more representative subsidy indicators and a wider coverage (panel data from 210 EU regions over the period 2004-2014) than has been used before. The data allow to better correct for sample selection bias than previous empirical studies. We find that, on average, CAP subsidies reduce the outflow of labor from agriculture, but the effect is almost entirely due to decoupled Pillar I payments. Coupled Pillar I payments have no impact on reducing labor outflow from agriculture, i.e. on preserving jobs in agriculture. The impact of Pillar II is mixed. Our estimates predict that an increase of 10 percent of the CAP budget would prevent an extra 16,000 people from leaving the EU agriculture sector each year. A 10 percent decoupling would save 13,000 agricultural jobs each year. However, the budgetary costs are large. The estimated cost is more than € 300,000 per year (or more than € 25,000 per month) per job saved in agriculture.},

	abstract = {Can we rise to the challenges of reform? It is argued that the CAP can and must be reformed. The question is not whether but when and, importantly, how and by whom it will be reformed. We should seize the initiative from within rather than allow reform to be imposed on us by others. The Doha Round, which we agreed should be a development round, was a good start but the biggest test of our real commitment will be the agriculture negotiations. There is no other sector in which the policies of rich countries impact so heavily on the developing world. The costs of failure will be high both within Europe and, more importantly, in the developing world. Changes in agricultural subsidies have to come first and the European Union and the United States have to show the way. The Mid-Term Review of CAP has produced some forward looking and radical proposals. We should break the long-standing link between support and production whilst continuing to protect our rural ways of life and the important roles that farmers play. This will transform the impact of the CAP both internally and externally. But the CAP should not be used as an instrument of cohesion policy, as the proposal for reassigning Second Pillar money between Member States seeks to do. Sommes nous prêts à relever le défi des réformes? On montre ici que la PAC peut être réformée et doit ľêtre. La question n'est pas de savoir ‘si’, mais ‘quand’ et surtout ‘comment et par qui’. Il nous faut prendre ľ‘initiative’ de ľintérieur, et ne pas nous laisser imposer des réformes par les autres. Nous avons accepté que la négotiation de Doha soit focalisée sur le développement, et c'est là un bon point de départ. Mais le test le plus probant de la réalité de notre engagement sera la négotiation agricole. Il n'y a pas de secteur où la politique des pays riches influe si fortement sur le monde en développement. Le coût ?un échec sera élevé en Europe, mais surtout dans le Tiers Monde. La première chose à faire est de modifier les régimes ? aide agricole. C'est àľ Union Européenne et aux Etats Unis de montrer ľ exemple. On trouvera dans la revue a mi parcourt de la PAC quelques perspectives ? avenir et certaines propositions assez radicales. Tout en préservant les modes de vie ruraux et le rôle des agriculteurs, il faut briser le lien qui existe depuis trop longtemps entre soutien et production. Cela devrait transformer ľ impact de la PAC, aussi bien a ľ intérieur qu'àľ'extérieur. Cependant, la PAC ne doit pas constituer un instrument de cohésion politique, comme essaient de le faire les propositions visant à réallouer aux pays membres ľ argent du ‘Second Pilier’. Können wir den Herausforderungen der Reform gerecht werden? Hier wird der Standpunkt vertreten, dass eine Reform der GAP erfolgen kann und muss. Die Frage lautet nicht, ob, sondern wann und vor allem wie und von wem die Reform durchgeführt werden soil. Wir als Beteiligte sollten die Initiative ergreifen und es nicht zulassen, dass uns die Reform von Außenstehenden aufgedrängt wird. Die Doha-Runde, bei der es sich gemäß gemeinsamer Übereinkunft urn eine Entwicklungsrunde handeln soil, stellt einen gelungenen Anfang dar, aber erst die Agrarverhandlungen werden zeigen, wie sehr uns die Reform am Herzen liegt. In keinem anderen Sektor üben die Politik-maßnahmen reicher Länder einen so großen Einfluss auf die Entwicklungsländer aus. Im Falle eines Scheiterns fallen innerhalb Europas und vor allem in den Entwicklungsländern hohe Kosten an. Zunächst müssen Veränderungen bei den Agrarsubventionen vorgenommen werden, wobei die Europäische Union und die USA die Richtung vorgeben müssen. Die Zwischenbewertung der GAP hat einige vorausschauende und radikale Aunderungsvorschläge hervorgebracht. Wir sollten zwar die seit langem bestehende Verbindung zwischen Stützung und Produktion kappen, aber dennoch die ländliche Lebensan und die wichtige Rolle erhalten, welche die Landwirte spielen. Dadurch würde die Auswirkung der GAP sowohl intern als auch extern grundlegend verändert. Die GAP sollte jedoch nicht als Instrument einer Kohäsionspolitik fungieren, wie es der Vorschlag zur Neuverteilung der Mittel aus der zweiten Säule zwischen den Mitgliedstaaten vorsieht.},

	abstract = {Starting the discussion about the framework 2021–2027, and regarding the increasing importance given to rural areas by the European Union, multifunctionality of agriculture and its positive externalities can be the leverage factor to a sustainable rural development. It is therefore crucial to identify the success issues in these territories where public investment can more effectively influence the private sector. Despite the existence of many indices of development, none of them is specifically designed for the evaluation of rural areas. This lack of rural development measures hampers the process of assessing the impact of public policies applied in a particular territory, or, in an ex-ante perspective, the identification of the areas where the use of public funds would be more effective. This work hence proposes the design of a Rural Development Index which would cover the defining characteristics of each region’s development. The index has been constructed based on four dimensions: population, social, economic and environmental, with each of them being composed of different indicators. The index is finally applied it to 15 municipalities in a Portuguese NUT III region (North Alentejo) using the most recent data available from the 2011 Portuguese Census. The use of the index has allowed a comparative analysis of values of each territorial unit in different years, producing some conclusions on the effectiveness of the implementation of public policies. It was also possible to identify the dimensions in which the public development policies can improve their results, and how these dimensions contribute to different development levels of the territories.},

For this reason, we conducted a quantitative analysis of the effects of public policies on the development of the Central Pyrenees from 1986 to 2001. During this period, around €170 million (US\$ 226.3 million) was invested in development of the Central Pyrenees through the Common Agricultural Policy and Regional Policy. However, in our analysis of correlations between several socioeconomic factors, we found that the number of inhabitants, farms, and employees in the primary and secondary sectors had decreased, while the tourist sector was becoming a major part of the economy. These findings seem to indicate that public policies had little effect; but although our analyses revealed that the various subsidies did little to promote structural improvement, they were important for supporting inhabitants (for example farmers) in the Pyrenees, because they are a form of complementary income, they allow communities to maintain farming activities, and they favor small enterprises linked to tourist activities—thus preventing depopulation. As the Pyrenees have little capacity for endogenous development, we argue that the current public policies should be maintained for the foreseeable future.},

The article is organized in five sections. The introductory section offers a brief account of the basic dimensions of the newly reformed CAP, which suggest how the CAP is destined to evolve in the near future. The next section is dedicated to the analysis of farm structures, agricultural and regional employment, agricultural incomes and regional development. The third section deals with the evolution of the CAP objectives, as well as the drivers connected to the recent CAP reforms. Next, there is a comprehensive presentation of the CAP impact on agriculture and rural areas of the member states. Finally, a number of conclusions are drawn regarding the path dependency of the CAP and its continued inefficiency on lowering social and spatial inequalities in rural areas.},

In the Rural Development Index (RDI) the rural development domains are represented by hundreds of partial socio-economic, environmental, infrastructural and administrative indicators/variables at NUTS-4 level (e.g. 991 variables/indicators describing various aspects of rural development in Poland; 340 variables/indicators in Slovakia). The weights of economic, social and environmental domains entering the RDI index are derived empirically from the econometrically estimated intra- and inter-regional migration function after selecting the ‘‘best’’ model from various alternative model speciﬁcations (e.g. panel estimate logistic regression nested error structure model, spatial effect models, etc.). The RDI is empirically applied to analysis of the main determinants of rural/regional development in individual rural areas in years 2002–2005 in Poland and Slovakia at NUTS-4 level. Due to its comprehensiveness the RDI Index is suitable both to analysis of the overall level of development of rural areas and to an evaluation of the impacts (impact indicator) of RD and structural programmes at regional levels (NUTS 2–5).},

Findings – Although simple, it performs slightly better than a much more elaborate system with which it has been compared. It effectively works by treating complex suffixes as compounds made up of simple suffixes, and removing the simple suffixes in a number of steps. In each step the removal of the suffix is made to depend upon the form of the remaining stem, which usually involves a measure of its syllable length.

This evaluation assessed how the current CAP affects GR in rural Europe, also local development and jobs.

Methods included literature review, EU survey, interviews and workshops, data analysis using correlation, multicriteria, comparative econometric and CGE modelling, and case studies in seven contrasting Member States (MS). It concluded CAP GR measures have a positive impact on YF numbers, business performance and local employment, varying from very minor to significant according to local context. For Pillar 2 aids, impacts and causes are clear, but it is too early to judge Pillar 1 YF supplements. Aids are most effective and efficient delivered in mixed-measure packages combining planning, investment, collaboration and advice, and conditional on beneficiary training. Impact is enhanced where institutional and fiscal policies ease access to land and capital. In very marginal areas, aid for rural diversification and services is also vital. The study recommended a more holistic, flexible and strategic approach to GR in the future CAP, also increased MS emphasis upon new entrants, innovation and rural quality of life provision.},

	abstract = {The European Union (EU) most likely will continue to adapt its Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) to a more liberal market policy. We assume that this process will take place in the next 20 years. A relevant question then is which European regions, under such conditions, have prospects to maintain a sustainable agriculture in terms of the objectives within the ‘People, Profit and Planet’ framework of sustainability. We explored the question by defining simple indicators for the 3 P-objectives, quantifying the indicators per region, ranking the regions per indicator and defining the prospect of a region in comparison to other regions. The approach is very robust, easy to update and indicative for quickly assessing future prospects of regions. The results are presented in three maps showing more than 160 regions of the EU-25 member countries classified according to their agricultural prospects for competitiveness (Profit), employment (People) and land use (Planet). By considering the three maps in combination, the overall prospects for sustainable agriculture under “liberalised” conditions can be assessed. Based on this quick scan, it is concluded that: (a) the few highly developed and highly productive regions in the UK, the Netherlands, France and Germany will out-compete the numerous still poorly developed and low-productive regions in the Southern and Eastern EU member states; (b) these regions in the UK, the Netherlands, France and Germany will maintain their already minimized and highly productive employment at the expense of the member states with a relatively high agrarian employment, notably Poland and the Baltic states; (c) the sparsely populated regions of France, Denmark, Scotland, Ireland, Czech Republic and Germany will maintain their agrarian land use, at the expense of densely populated regions with relatively small holdings in Poland, Italy, Germany, Portugal and Spain. Policy makers and entrepreneurs can obtain an integrative view by taking into account the three prospect maps to support decision-making on long-term policies and sustainable investments in terms of the 3 Ps.},

	abstract = {The Amazon forests, the Northern artic regions, the Australian bush and Siberian plains all have very low demographic densities, but they are rarely studied as pertaining to the same global category. It appears, however, that when considering sparsely populated regions (SPR) globally they share not only demographical characteristics, but also a number of features in their economic, political, spatial and social configuration, and more importantly in visions of nature and the environment, which make them different from more densely populated areas. The point of this paper is to demonstrate that despite obvious ecological and climatic differences, SPR can be considered as a specific geographical category and in so doing we are able to reveal and explain aspects until now imperfectly framed under the ‘rural’ category which they are generally put into. This point is far from anecdotal, since contrary to common assumptions, SPR are still largely dominant today on Earth in terms of extension. Considering them as a unique category can therefore be an important step forward in cross-continental rural studies.},

	abstract = {Within the renewable energy resources, biomasses play a crucial role. The year 2008, might be remembered as the time when the world understood the linkage and interdependence between food and energy. A number of factors including subsidies, high oil prices, increasing demand from emerging countries and lower yields in some countries, as well as lower levels of world food stocks, resulted in soaring food prices. As consequences, number of countries adopted the opportunity to boost the development of biofuel as a solution for energy insecurity, the threat of climate change and to enhance agriculture and rural development. In the Eu rural areas amount for 92 per cent of the EU surface but the per capita income is around the third less. Diversification of household income, aiming at revitalising and avoiding the rural areas’ progressive degradation and abandonment is crucial. In fact agriculture can play several roles in addition to its primary function of producing food. The growing attention given to the non agricultural commodity outputs (particularly renewable energy) is a clear example. Rural is not synonymous with decline or with agriculture. The distinctions between rural and urban areas are obsolete and rural areas are not homogenous, with uniform bonds or same opportunity. This study analyses the dimension of renewable energy as a diversification activity in the European rural areas. The objectives of this study are to identify: the key added values of bioenergy production in rural area; the regions/areas benefitting or that might benefit from the promotion of bioenergy production; policies in the agricultural sector that could be designed to ensure benefits to rural areas from the production and provision of bioenergy; which stakeholders are mostly (positively or negatively) affected from the production of biomass.},

It is assumed that the assessment of Rural Development Programme impacts, in the way it is applied nowadays, is not able to satisfy the need for a deep and useful evaluation. The outcomes of evaluation should be a major tool for policy design. The Common Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (CMEF), which was introduced by the EU for the evaluation of Rural Development Programmes is criticized as a very “economic indicator” oriented system. Many data are required for the calculation of CMEF indicators, which are not available in a lot of EU member states. This research aims to identify problems and shortcomings occurred during the phases of rural development policy design, implementation and evaluation, which influence the success of such policy programmes. Based on a previous research, where network analysis was applied, the researchers made an attempt to examine the problems with the use of in-depth interviews and focus group. Measure for the modernisation of agricultural holdings in Greece was used as a case study. Complexity in processes, bureaucracy, delays, lack of data at regional and national level, lack “evaluation culture” seem to be the most crucial factors of failure.},

There is significant variation in terms of both the policies and external drivers that are taken into account in global and European outlooks, driven predominantly by the heterogeneity in focus of studies, the approach applied and/or external pressures. An increasing number of studies take on board the new CAP challenges. However, an area where improvements are needed is in the understanding of the sensitivity of policy effects to assumptions on external drivers. Two key modelling approaches applied for policy impact analysis include structural models and econometric models, with the former dominating the latter mainly due to its better adaptability to the needs of policy makers. However, with the CAP evolving towards ever more complex instruments, the relevance and predictive accuracy of structural models will possibly improve only as long as methodological and data issues are addressed.},

Close cooperation, deep integration and convergence are the major priorities for the EU. Anyway, these principles are not always reﬂected in the EU-wide policies which are implemented through ﬁnancial support mechanisms. The direct payments ﬁnancial support mechanism under the Common Agricultural Policy, the main instrument for promoting convergence in development of Member States’ agricultural sectors and rural sustainability, faces critique for failing to meet its objectives. One of the major deﬁciencies of the direct payments scheme is that it allocates more resources to already developed agricultural sectors of the older Member States and less resources to developing ones thus increasing the divergence among the Member States. The aim of this paper is to suggest new mechanisms for direct payment funds redistribution across the EU Member States which are based on the methodological principles that would more precisely correspond to the aims of convergence, transparency and fair redistribution. The results show that, regardless of the method chosen (to support more or less eﬀective agricultural sectors of EU Member States), the proposed methodology lowers diﬀerences in direct payment rates among the EU Member States by two-fold. This ensures correspondence to the goal of convergence within the EU.},

Analysis of the principal characteristics of these systems is essential during a time in which the new CAP is being designed for the period 2021-2027. The research is focused on the analysis of the agricultural features of 228 regional areas (NUTS 2) of the 28 European Union (EU) countries. It considers two specific sets of environmental and socio-economic indicators provided by the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). The main factors that differentiate agricultural systems in EU regions from one another were identified with the application of principal component analysis, while the classification of the same regions in homogeneous groups was carried out through hierarchical cluster analysis. The results clearly show that some groups of “homogeneous” EU regions such as the Natura 2000 area and the family-run agricultural system, which have weaker agricultural structures than the average of the 228 EU regions considered in this study, have a greater need for the restructuring of their agricultural systems than others (e.g., the professional agricultural system and the food industry system). The results confirm that policy design should not consider EU agriculture as a whole, but should take into account the environmental and structural specificities of agricultural holdings, as well as the different training levels of farm managers.},

These approaches and policies were associated with a ‘geographical imagination’ of rural space and rurality as a place of production, where the emphasis was on sectoral policies. In Europe today the discourse has changed dramatically. The current dominant geographical imagination of rurality is shifted to consumption and leisure, following both speciﬁc structural trends internally to rural areas and the more general post-modern trend away from production per se. These trends are discussed in a highly inﬂuential European document, the European Spatial Development Perspective (ESDP) introduced in Leipzig in 1994 and formally adopted in 1999. In this document a new language and new policy guidelines are introduced, which openly support the consumption/leisure imagination, introducing at the same time spatial policies, which will deal more effectively with urban and rural spaces. Bearing this in mind, this article will try ﬁrst to describe the two phases of imagining rurality in Europe (production versus consumption/leisure) and second their impact on southern European (SE) rural regions.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses (ex ante) the issue of the potential impact of the modulation of direct payments on a sector and regional scale in the Czech Republic. The ultimate version of the compulsory modulation measure adopted under the Health Check of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) assumes the reduction of direct payments if the total individual claim exceeds 5 thousand € or 300 thousand € level. The Czech agricultural sector will be impacted by this measure substantially, given the large scale farming enterprises. In 2013, the total farmers’ direct payments will be cut by more than 10\% (€ 91 million). Moreover, there are regional differences in farm structures (the average farm size and the extent of collectivization) which will bring about various effects of policies in the heterogeneous regions. The analysis further shows that the regions that are least affected are at the same time more environmental sensitive and are mostly situated in the mountainous or sub-mountainous parts of the country or more urban areas than the average. Hence the effect of the modulation, from a purely environmental perspective, may not contradict the objectives of other environmental policies. That is to say the regions that need support the most will be reduced the least. However, the picture is less obvious in the regional economies where more rural regions (potentially more vulnerable with socio-economic problems) tend to be more affected.},

Potential effects of networking activities are presented on the basis of findings of surveys conducted among agencies in Romania and (potential) LEADER beneficiaries in Romania, Hungary and Germany in 2008. We also discuss the importance of European-wide networking and draw conclusions on whether networking should be funded or not. Based on our findings, we conclude that: 1) cost-efficient informal networking can have a considerable impact on the implementation of policy measures for rural development; 2) financial support is important if networks need to be stimulated and channelled, and to guarantee continuity; and 3) networking is particularly important for the new member states of the European Union, where, moreover, additional attention should be paid to administrative networking.},

	abstract = {EU agriculture and rural areas face significant medium-term challenges arising from existing and ‘new’ sources; as acknowledged in the EU2020 vision. The European Commission has placed emphasis upon innovation as a key element in achieving transformation, in the coming decade. Findings from a recent study for the European Parliament highlight the potential role of Pillar 2 rural development programmes as vehicles for enabling innovation. Key roles include supporting knowledge exchange; collaboration; and research-into-practice linkages. Effective knowledge exchange (KE) is a critical element, but innovation in KE itself is often needed. Collaboration can be valuable in fostering cross-sectoral linkages, and communities of learning show innovation potential. Integration of measures in tailored packages appears to increase the scope for innovation. Equally important, there is a vital need for innovation in policy design and delivery, to enable a cost-effective transformation of agriculture and rural areas. The CAP proposals 2014-2020 make a positive contribution to better promote innovation through Pillar 2, but there is room for improvement. Models for policy innovation adapted from experience in commercial organisations are suggested as worthy of further research.},

However, until now, not much has been examined about the actual contribution of these policy actions and programmes to the everyday life of farm women; there is a considerable gap in the data about women in farming across Europe, particularly for new member states. The article addresses this issue by focusing on the situation of gender equality on farms in Slovenia. Pertaining to two measures of The Rural Development Programme 2004–2006 – the Setting Up of Young Farmers and the Early Retirement of Farmers – the aim of the analysis is to compare the beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries of these two measures at family farms in terms of their development capacities and their inclination towards gender equality. Results based on the survey data ‘Generations and Gender Relations on Slovenian Farms 2007’ revealed the above-mentioned measures did indeed reach those family farms that showed better development capacities in terms of economic and demographic conditions. However, the farms did not show significant development in terms of gender equality as examined through division of work and decision-making on family farms. The rigidity in gender statuses and roles on family farms is explained and discussed through the issue of unequal access of women to farmland ownership and agricultural education, and through persistently weak institutional support to increase political participation and power for farm women.},

The consequences of policy change were evaluated, using a bi-objective linear programming model that simulates farmers’ preferred behaviour. The output of the model consists of economic, social and environmental indicators aimed at quantifying the impact of the scenarios on different aspects of sustainability relevant for irrigated farming systems. The results show a clear trade-off between socio-economic and environmental sustainability. This emphasises the need to balance water conservation with agricultural policy and rural development objectives.

	abstract = {EU expenditures for Rural Development, having increased from 2.9\% of the total Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) budget in the 1990s to 12.3\% in the beginning of the 2010s, reflect the growing strategic and societal values attached to this policy in addressing the new global challenges for rural areas in the enlarged EU. The analysis of the recent and ongoing reforms shows that Rural Development Programmes (RDP) made substantial progress towards sectoral integration and thematic broadening, and, at the same time, provided continuity of well-established and important measures. Yet, under growing budget constraints, better targeting of funds becomes even more crucial (European Court of Auditors, 2011). Comparing the design and allocation practices of Regional RDPs, however, reveals significant differences in targeting strategies, all too often based on the implementation history and experience of previous periods. Better availability, coordination and digital connectivity of expenditure data and other data sources across the EU encouraged the adoption of the Common Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (CMEF), aimed at more clearly depicting intervention needs and effects at the regional scale (NUTS2–NUTS3) (NUTS (Nomenclature des unités territoriales statistiques) is a EU geocode standard for referencing spatial subunits for statistical purposes). The EU project SPARD (Spatial Analysis of Rural Development Measures) took those data as a starting point to find out more about the causal relationships between RD measure implementation, and their determining factors and impacts with a specific look at their spatial dimension: in which rural development measures is success determined by neighbourhood conditions, and at what scale? SPARD developed and applied new methodological approaches, particularly spatial econometrics, to evaluate selected measures that contribute to improved competitiveness, environmental performance and rural viability. The results are presented in this special issue in four thematic foci:•Analysing RDP performance by applying spatial econometric modelling (theory, procedures, key results) on RDP payments at the national and European scale.•Effectiveness and efficiency of RDP participation towards impacts at the regional scale: an in-depth view of European case studies, specific measures, indicators and shortcomings of the CMEF.•Learning about spatial and non-spatial determinants of participation in RDP.•Experiences and requirements related to the CAP 2020 and the improvement of the CMEF. Overall, the results emphasise the difficulty of evaluating of RDPs, even when using much more sophisticated instruments than those used in the current evaluation practices. While a lack of appropriate information remains an issue, the experience of SPARD also underscores the challenge of matching the quest for generalised approaches and the need to consider ad hoc local determinants, as well as the trade-off between the benefits of higher precision and the costs of implied information burden.},

	abstract = {Periodic evaluation of EU Member States Rural Development Programme (RDP) specific policy interventions is considered crucial in policy development. The main reasons for the evaluation of specific policy interventions are the assessment of a programme’s impact, the improvement of programme management and administration, identification of necessary improvements in the delivery of interventions and meeting the accountability. The core question to be answered in programme evaluation is whether the stated objectives are accomplished by particular intervention (support or „treatment” provided to programme participants). The main problem in the process of evaluation is the assessment of the counterfactual outcome by modelling the situation where treatment is absent. The counterfactual outcome has to be estimated by statistical methods as it is usually not observed. General equilibrium effects occur when a programme affects units other than its participants. The most important possible impacts are the substitution effect and the displacement effect. Displacement effects are unplanned and indirect. They usually play a more important role in the evaluation at the programme level than in the evaluation of RDP individual measures. Displacement effect is the programme effect that occurs in a programme area at expense of another area. It takes place if farms located in one geographical area, which is not a subject to RD support, becomes adversely affected by a support provided to farms located in another geographically area. The existing study provides an assessment of the displacement effects on the employment in unsupported units at the programme level after the net effects on the employment calculated at the measure level are aggregated over the entire programme.},

The main results show how the Second Pillar has mainly supported small and medium-sized farms with tourism activities and located in disadvantaged areas.

New rural policy stresses the focus on bottom-up approach, self-organization and cooperation between territorial government and local community. This highlights the need to align innovative approaches with available policy instruments to accelerate rural development. Currently rural development initiators might vitalize their innovative ideas and mobilize followers by accessing the EU support scheme using LEADER programme through local action groups (LAGs). However, the geographical distribution and activeness of Lithuanian LAGs vary from region to region in terms of activeness and absorption of EU support and there are reasons behind. This study aims to explain the role of local action groups in innovative bottom-up rural development from a new social movement theory approach. It is argued in the study that LAGs hold a potential to drive innovative rural development in a form of a new social movement, which might specifically emerge in particular field due to the idea proposed by particular local community actors and their ability to mobilize resources. Finally, this study proposes insights for scientific discussion regarding the possibility to explain the reasons of LAGs disparities in the absorption of EU support from a new social movement approach.

Such sectors are usually related with people basic needs; in the current economic crisis, the agriculture and food sector stand out. The present study endeavours to examine the potentials of agriculture in promoting an integrated development in a regional rural economy, through capturing and recording its interconnections with other sectors of economic activity. Input-Output analysis was applied along with the construction of a regional model intending to examine both the contribution of the primary sector in the regional economy, as well as the impact of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform on the entire local economy. By employing an analytical tool, it is demonstrated that the impact of the new CAP is not limited to the primary sector, but it - directly and indirectly affects other sectors, as well as the total output, employment and household income of the region. Results suggest that agriculture is an important driver of growth throughout the region, contributing to the increase of the local gross output by approximately €300mil. only by the inflow of funds, while 14\% of it is diffused into sectors other than agriculture.},

The issue was also noticed at the level of the European Union, which is expressed among others by creating sectoral policies, including the Common Agricultural Policy. The aim of the article is to determine the inﬂuence of the Common Agricultural Policy on the level of socio-economic sustainability of farms in Poland. The authors formulate a hypothesis that the existing solutions serve the achievement of economic sustainability, determined by the agricultural to non-agricultural income ratio, but they do not provide sustainability of farms in terms of the social element understood as taking income disparities into consideration. In the article, panel regression and the ratio of income from representative FADN farms to average annual gross salary per employee in Poland in the years 2004–2017 were used. It was found that thanks to the support from the Common Agricultural Policy, the average income of farms comes close to the average income of the non-agricultural sector. However, the inﬂuence of the subsidies on changes in economic sustainability was uneven in various economic size classes of farms—the strongest farms beneﬁted the most, which means that social sustainability in terms of equal distribution of income was not achieved.},

	abstract = {Recently, the EU policy measures have been widely applied to encourage early retirement from farming. Current age structure of society requires opposite approach. Key challenges for rural development policy aiming to increase quality of life of elder people are dealing not only with traditional help and support measures, but also with the involvement of elder generation into economic and social life. New EU agricultural policy measures should ensure that funding and institutional incentives support extending working and active social life of elder farmers. One of the possible ways to change the approach deals with servitization. However, despite implementation of service-driven business model in agriculture, which opened new possibilities to use knowledge and experience of old generation, the servitization movement is still weak in agriculture. Restricted adoption of service-driven business models in agriculture largely depends on the lack of research on this topic and guidelines for practitioners. The aim of this paper is to conceptualize the organizational model aiming to implement product-service system in agricultural business by joint efforts of elder farmers and beginning gardeners. Case study on innovative servitization initiative “Rent a piece of garden” in rural areas of Lithuania is used as an illustration of innovative business model in agriculture and territorial servitization with multifaceted impact on vitality of ageing rural community and as a source to gain new knowledge on how to organize similar projects.},

	abstract = {The new European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) was purposely established to “contribute to the promotion of sustainable rural development throughout the EU community”. This paper addresses the sustainability of the EAFRD from a triple bottom line perspective in a multiregional input-output model. This framework allows us to study both the trade relations within the EU target regions and also the relations of the EU with some other regions in the world. Additionally, the model allows us to determine the losses (leakages) or gains (boosts and feedbacks) of a wide range of effects. On the other hand, this framework allows a simultaneous consideration of socioeconomic and environmental fund effects to identify their causes and flows and to clarify and reallocate benefits and responsibilities across levels and regions. The estimation of direct and indirect impact effects in an EU country clarifies the following: a) how the leakages to other regions generate a final economic impact that redistributes the prior fund distribution; b) how relevant the countries' participation in global production chains are; and c) how the potential existence of an ecological unequal exchange is assessed. The main data originate from the WIOD database and the European Network for Rural Development.},

	abstract = {The majority of national governments now dedicate themselves to sustainable development as it aims to produce a long-term, positive relationship between civilization and life-supporting planetary resources. By doing so, societies have also embraced indicators as tools to provide comprehensive assessment of the current position, gauge improvement, and help set future development goals; however there remains no unanimous agreement regarding their theoretical foundation, design, nor use. The number of sustainability measures available for quantifying development is overwhelming to planners, scientists, and policymakers, thus clariﬁcation of interrelationships, redundancy, and spatial distributions is needed. First, this study reduced and described a set of 30 multi-metric sustainability indices across 36 European nations. A multivariate factor analysis identiﬁed ﬁve major dimensions (or axes) that conveyed over 80\% of the total variation of the original 30 development measures. Second, spatial autoregressive analyses of childhood mortality, endangered species density, and population growth rate revealed statistical correlations with one or more of the ﬁve development factors. The ﬁve axes of sustainable development are expressions of: prosperity, equality, and governance; quality of life; ecosystem integrity; environmentally efﬁcient happiness; and environmental management. Of these, Factor 1 (prosperity, equality, and governance) explained more than one-third of the total variance, and positively clustered in northwest Europe and negatively in southeast Europe. Results suggest that a few key indicators could be used when evaluating a country's overall development status during continental and global scale sustainability assessments. Lastly, the ﬁndings reveal an overall underrepresentation of ecological (biosphere) wellbeing within current measures of sustainable development.},

As a first step in designing the CHERMUG games a narrative literature review was carried out to establish whether similar games, animations and simulations already existed. Search terms used in the literature review included varied terms for digital games, simulations and animations, terms relevant to the twin goals of learning and engagement in games and terms for research methods and statistics. Application of the inclusion criteria led to 26 papers which were considered relevant. Synthesis of the papers suggested that there is reason to be optimistic that a game-based approach might be effective in learning in this area.},

	doi = {10.1186/1472-6920-14-70},
	abstract = {Background: While statistics is increasingly taught as part of the medical curriculum, it can be an unpopular subject and feedback from students indicates that some find it more difficult than other subjects. Understanding attitudes towards statistics on entry to graduate entry medical programmes is particularly important, given that many students may have been exposed to quantitative courses in their previous degree and hence bring preconceptions of their ability and interest to their medical education programme. The aim of this study therefore is to explore, for the first time, attitudes towards statistics of graduate entry medical students from a variety of backgrounds and focus on understanding the role of prior learning experiences. Methods: 121 first year graduate entry medical students completed the Survey of Attitudes toward Statistics instrument together with information on demographics and prior learning experiences. Results: Students tended to appreciate the relevance of statistics in their professional life and be prepared to put effort into learning statistics. They had neutral to positive attitudes about their interest in statistics and their intellectual knowledge and skills when applied to it. Their feelings towards statistics were slightly less positive e. g. feelings of insecurity, stress, fear and frustration and they tended to view statistics as difficult. Even though 85\% of students had taken a quantitative course in the past, only 24\% of students described it as likely that they would take any course in statistics if the choice was theirs. How well students felt they had performed in mathematics in the past was a strong predictor of many of the components of attitudes. Conclusion: The teaching of statistics to medical students should start with addressing the association between students' past experiences in mathematics and their attitudes towards statistics and encouraging students to recognise the difference between the two disciplines. Addressing these issues may reduce students' anxiety and perception of difficulty at the start of their learning experience and encourage students to engage with statistics in their future careers.},

This finding is robust to the inclusion in the analysis of different variables that may affect regional governance. Likewise, the observed effect of neighbouring regions does not depend on the specific dimension of governance considered, the spatial weights matrix used to describe the spatial linkages between the European regions, or the econometric specification employed to capture the nature of spatial spillovers. The results also show that policy innovations related to governance spread from regions with high and intermediate levels of quality of government.},

In this paper, we review trends within agricultural knowledge and advice networks both internationally and in Australia, to anticipate and prepare for potential transformations in these networks. Through a combined structured and traditional review of relevant literature, we come to three key conclusions regarding the state-of-the-art. First, the connectivity of humans and technologies in agricultural knowledge and advice networks and value chains will likely continue to increase. Second, transparency of agricultural practices and informational interaction between farmers, advisors, agri-businesses, consumers and regulators will drive and be driven by growing connectivity. Finally, there are likely to be challenges balancing the priorities of various agricultural stakeholders as agricultural innovation systems digitalise.

To test this, programming rules are experimentally evaluated on the implementation of CAP 2014-2020 in Slovenia. The experiment shows that while measures and resources broadly correspond to policy objectives, the specific relevance of measures is generally weak and has potential effects dispersed among several objectives, resulting in high costs for individual objectives at best.

However, research remains somewhat scarce on the contributing mechanism of land consolidation with production factors to regional rural economies. In this study, we sampled 4710 land consolidation projects during the year of 2006–2016 and recorded their benefits to the rural economies within the project area, in the mountainous and hilly rural areas in Southeast China. A random forest (RF) model was used to explain the variation of rural economic indicators quantitatively and partition the relative importance of each factor from land consolidation projects. The results showed that land consolidation contributed to the promotion of rural economies. The R2 of the RF models were 66.55\% (for grain production increment), 55.19\% (for net agricultural income increment), 37.01\% (for land rental income), and 42.60\% (for labor income) respectively. Despite the direct input factors especially newly added cropland area and total investment of land consolidation project dominant across the study area, the most important factors varied over the years and across counties considerably. Noteworthily in specific years and several counties (e.g. those in the north of study area), factors reflecting technological efficiency such as the mechanized agricultural area and the land-leveling area could also make primary contribution to grain production increment and net agricultural income increment. Moreover, the marginal returns law and the scarcity of land resources in the mountainous and hilly areas were also suggested. The results revealed the significance of engineering measures for technological efficiency. The study highlights the importance of land consolidation to regional rural economies in mountainous and hilly areas, and provides valuable insights for promoting the efficiency of regional rural land consolidation arrangements in the future.},

	abstract = {A world with large disparities in development between rural and urban areas could never achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs). Issues related to agriculture, rural areas, and farmers are fundamental to the stability and people's welfare of China as well as other developing countries. Despite the growing demand and national initiative for rural revitalization, rural innovation has received little attention in the innovation literature. Drawing from the new growth theory, institutional theory and innovation system theory, this paper proposes the rural innovation system, which is a complex socioeconomic network that aims to revitalize the countryside and achieve balanced and sustainable development. This paper compares the rural and urban innovation system, introduces a theoretical structural model of the rural innovation system, including a) technology innovation, b) institutional and management innovation, and c) community-based network and intermediary platform innovation. Then it outlines the future challenges in fostering a strong rural innovation system. The rural innovation system proposed makes direct contributions to the literature of rural studies, innovation system, and public policy, and offers both China and the world a new perspective for realizing rural revitalization, anti-poverty and global sustainable development.},

This is done through the case study on the rural development programs (RDPs) in the EU. Results regarding methodologies are then contrasted with the international context in order to provide solid insights to evaluators and program managing authorities facing ex ante impact assessment.Research design:All European RDPs from the period 2007 through 2013 (a total of 88) and their corresponding available ex ante evaluations (a total of 70) were analyzed focusing on the socioeconomic impact assessment.Results:Only 46.6\% of the regions provide quantified impact estimations on socioeconomic impacts in spite of it being a compulsory task demanded by the European Commission (EC). Recommended methods by the EC are mostly used, but there is a lack of mixed method approaches since qualitative methods are used in substitution of quantitative ones. Two main difficulties argued were the complexity of program impacts and the lack of needed program information.Conclusions:Qualitative approaches on their own have been found as not suitable for ex ante impact assessment, while quantitative approaches?such as microsimulation models?provide a good approximation to actual impacts. However, time and budgetary constraints make that quantitative and mixed methods should be mainly applied on the most relevant impacts for the program success.},

The paper tries to identify some of the factors that can explain the differences between MS in terms of recent distribution and the evolution over time of the distribution of DPs, comparing results of different regression models. The analysis has confirmed that the concentration of direct payments is very heterogeneous across EU Member States and that it reaches very high values in some of them. This is even truer when, as in this paper, non-beneficiary farms are accounted for in the analysis of the DP distribution. The results support the idea that a large part of the concentration of the DP support is generated by the way land is distributed among farms. The results do not support the hypothesis that the models of implementation of the Single Payment Scheme can explain the observed differences among Member States in terms of DP concentration.

	abstract = {The legislator of the European Union (EU) has commissioned the European Commission (EC) to evaluate Pillar 1 measures of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), particularly direct income payments. The legislator has laid out the policy objectives and has instructed the EC to specify the impact indicators for the evaluation. This policy brief argues that the EC had to accept the task, which could not be solved with the state-of-the-art methodology generally followed by professional economists. However, the objectives have not been clearly defined by the legislator, and the EC has failed to suggest a clear definition of objectives to measure the expected positive changes resulting from the policy intervention. Moreover, the approach of the EC does not solve the identification problem; it failed to compare the situation with and without direct payments. Thus, the EC is unable to justify the need for direct payments based on its diagnosis and to show that the measure is effective and efficient. The EC uses so-called impact indicators in line with the proposal of the legislator. Specific indicators have been selected to relate to specific objectives (e. g., changes in entrepreneurial income are considered to contribute to the change in the objective 'variable production'). This article argues that this relationship has to be challenged. The same conclusion holds for the impact indicator 'factor income'. The impact indicators used by the EC provide no information about the direct impact on the specific objective variables. Moreover, the EC approach only focuses on potential benefits, and competely neglects economic costs.},

It is our opinion that FADN data are inadequate to be used in policy evaluation due to the specifics of selection of the sample. First, there is a mismatch between farms that are included in the sample and farms that are entitled to receive direct payments. Second, and possibly even more importantly, the information collected, so-called farm income, does not represent farmers’ actual income. Third, the data are neither consistent in time nor between Member States. This policy brief reports on selected data problems for selected EU countries. The analysis leads to the final conclusion that the present setup of FADN data is inadequate for the data to be used to evaluate EU farm income policy. This conclusion is completely in line with the European Court of Auditors’ Report (European Court of Auditors, 2016).},

However, the reallocation of funds from the first to the second pillar has considerably larger negative effects on gross value added and employment in agriculture than the case of the second pillar budget reduction. On the other hand, the reallocation of funds will produce small but positive effects on the remaining sectors of the economy and the GDP.

We present results for four estimators which differ in how they eliminate the fixed effects and how they address the endogeneity of the lagged dependent variable. The results suggest that there were few desirable effects on job maintenance in agriculture. While there is some indication that investment subsidies have halted labour shedding on farms, a rise in the general wage level reduced labour use in agriculture. Changes in direct payments had no employment effects. Generally, labour adjustment exhibits a strong path dependency.},

The objective of this paper is to evaluate the effect of decoupling and related policy and market scenarios, as introduced in the 2003 CAP reform, by way of selected agriculture sustainability indicators and through the aggregation of individual farm-household simulated behaviour. The approach is based on the use of a Net Present Value-maximising dynamic farm-household model. The model is implemented on 80 farm-households to simulate the reaction to scenarios of different agricultural systems in 8 EU countries. The results are measured through three main indicators – represented by farm income, labour use and nitrogen use – evaluated over a period of 14 years. The results of individual farm-households are aggregated first using the concept of farming system and then based on a cluster analysis using the results in different scenarios as discriminant variables. The results show that the CAP as a whole is crucial for the sustainability of farming systems in terms of income and employment, but also provides incentives for higher use of inputs, suggesting a trade-off between social and environmental sustainability concerns. In the range of variation considered, nitrogen and labour use appear much more reactive than income and indicate much higher variability across farms and scenarios. The aggregation by agricultural system denotes rather different behaviour among systems. However, the cluster analysis shows that results appear to be better interpreted by patterns of individual characteristics (location in the plain, structure, asset endowment, labour, etc.) than by country, specialisation or technology.},

We estimate a system of three equations, including a censored model, using the French Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) database. We find that hired labour and contract labour are substitutes as expected, but that hired labour and family labour are complements. This may reveal complementarities between management tasks (which are specifically for the farm head and family labour) and technical operations (the only operations performed by hired labour). In addition, we find that, in general, crop area payments and Single Farm Payments (SFP) have reduced farm labour, while agri-environmental payments, Less Favoured Area (LFA) payments and investment subsidies have increased it. Our results agree with most of the literature that coupled and decoupled area payments reduce labour use on farms.},

It considers a large sample of Italian farm families and applies the Gini decomposition approach. The analysis accounts for direct payments of the Pillar 1 (decoupled, coupled and modulation payments) and of the Pillar 2 of the CAP (agro-environmental and compensatory payments). While the overall amount of direct payments reduces income concentration, the situation is very different among the tools under consideration. Furthermore, the situation differs among the three altimetry zones in which the full sample has been disaggregated. Direct payments as a whole have been effective in pursuing a more equitable distribution of income, particularly in mountain zones. Thus any reduction of the budget for such policy will likely result in an increase of income concentration. The shift of financial resources between Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 will not necessarily result in a more equitable income distribution. However, instruments such as modulation, decoupled payments and compensatory allowances have been found to be promising tools for reaching this goal.},

This study centres its attention on the labour use aspect of the circular economy and aims to examine the potential for green economy measures to create green jobs in the agriculture sector. As a methodological approach, we combine “top-down” and “bottom-up” analyses of the green economy experience of Slovenia, where agri-environmental measures (AEM) play an essential role in the Slovenian rural development programme (2007–2014), with the highest amount of subsidies per unit of output among the 10 new European Union Member States. The results show that an AEM adoption of green policy measures by very large dairy and field crop farms significantly increases total labour use: while for field crop farms this increase is in hired labour, for dairy farms this increase is in family labour. While hired and family labour perform as substitutes for very large dairy farms, they perform as complements for very large field crop farms. The present study suggests further steps towards identifying the green economy measures that are needed to create green jobs in the agriculture sector for rural youth.},

The main results show that accession to the EU will lead to great positive effects in Romania, which vary according to the region considered. Regarding these, the Southern and the North-Eastern regions are those in which benefits tend to be concentrated. In all the regions, policy seems to be able to absorb unemployment. Finally, policy gives the impression of reducing regional and sectoral income disparities, leading to a more balanced development. On the contrary, in terms of employment, policy increases divergences, albeit, at a regional level, there is a general tendency towards a reduction of sectoral disparities.},

	abstract = {With the ongoing “Health Check” and the decisions needed for after 2013, the Common Agricultural Policy is likely to see another major reform and an increase in compulsory modulation. By employing a regional model, this paper compares the long-term impact of spending along the Pillar 2 Axes in NUTS3 areas on selected indicators of sustainability in several peripheral areas across Europe. The four case study areas are: Pinzgau-Pongau (a tourism-dominated alpine area in Austria), the Wetterau (an urbanised industrial area in Germany), Gorenjska (a tourism and manufacturing dominated area in Slovenia) and Caithness-Sutherland (a remote area in Scotland). The results suggest although devolution in European rural development policy has taken over the last 10 years, there is further need to restore place-based stewardship of public goods and services as well as private investments across rural areas in the European Union. Increasing the importance of Axis 2 and Axis 3 measures (part of CAP Pillar 2) therefore seems an obvious choice for the future. Furthermore, it is clear that the effects of wider societal trends such as the decreasing importance of agriculture, commuting and migration, can be weakened or amplified by EU funding but can not be reversed or significantly changed.},

	url = {https://ideas.repec.org/p/ags/eaa109/44731.html},
	abstract = {The scarce presence of young farmers is commonly considered one of the main weak points in the competitiveness of European agriculture. Firstly, the lack of young farmers puts under risk the survival of the sector itself, given that the main effect of an inadequate rate of generational turnover is that the exit of farms from the sector for ageing is not balanced by the entry of new farms run by young farmers. Secondly, the competitiveness of the sector suffer from the lower investment and innovation propensity of elder farmers. For these reasons, and also to slow down the pace of depopulation in most remote rural areas, the EU has always support the entry of young entrepreneurs in the primary sector. With the more recent CAP reforms, the main effort in this matter has been that of stressing the ties between the economic incentives for young farmers and the process of farm diversification and structural change within the more general framework of rural development, according to which is the rural area vitality as a whole that requires a positive demographic trend. In spite of the evident effort of the EU to this end, the effectiveness of the policy tools on the table is still quite debatable. In particular, it is questioned whether the “new” farms that benefitted by the aid can be really considered as the “outcome” of the financial support. The paper opens with a comparative description of the ageing process in the primary sector of the main EU Member States, with the double goal of showing its evolution and offering an updated picture of the issue. The dynamic of the process is caught by the construction of the migratory balances calculated for 5 age brackets. The second step is to show the available data on the implementation of the measure in favour of young farmers included in the Rural Development Programmes for the 2000-2006 planning period with a specific focus on the Italian case. This provides some evidences and hints of reflection about the effectiveness of this policy in the light of which the novelties of Reg. 1783/03 are discussed. Furthermore, the paper provides a short summary of the main contents of the resolution approved by the European Parliament on the 5th June 2008. The document, while acknowledging the persistent problem within European agriculture, moves an open and specific criticism not only to the scarce efficacy displayed by the CAP in counteracting the problem, but also points out the role that the CAP actively played in contributing to cause this situation. Some concluding remarks are given in the last section.},

The agricultural household decision-making model provides the conceptual and theoretical framework to examine the interaction between government subsidies and farmers’ time allocation decisions. The relationship postulated is that ‘decoupling’ of agricultural support from production would probably result in a decline in the return to farm labour but it would also lead to an increase in household wealth. The effect of these factors on how farmers allocate their time is tested empirically using labour participation and labour supply models. The models developed are sufficiently general for application elsewhere. The main findings for the Irish situation are that the decoupling of direct payments is likely to increase the probability of farmers participating in the off-farm employment market and that the amount of time allocated to off-farm work will increase.},

Employment levels will be affected within the farming sector and probably non-agricultural sector will feel the pinch too. Policies influencing employment levels attract the attention of the media and the public. Therefore, policy makers are more sensitive on employment issues than rural and agricultural policies as it is widely admitted that no vibrant regions in Europe can be envisioned without enhancing job opportunities. The influence of CAP reform on employment has not been thoroughly studied within a comprehensive approach, accounting for agricultural and non-agricultural effects and covering the diversity of EU rural regions. In this research work, five EU regions [Emilia Romagna (IT), East Wales (UK), Anatoliki Makedonia and Thraki (GR), Östergötland (SWE) and Kassel (GER)] have been selected and studied to identify and measure CAP’s effects on employment throughout the regional economy. A framework of three different approaches (Participatory Process/desk research, PMP, I-O) was developed and then applied to those five EU regions to trace out the current and anticipated employment effects of Pillar I and II. The main focus of this work is on consolidating results derived from different models, applied to five EU regions, to deduce valuable policy generalizations and to derive conclusions that guide policy makers on decisions related to regional and rural development. The results offer a comprehensive picture of the impacts of CAP reforms on regional economies and employment enriching the understanding of the range and diversity of contexts in which CAP is being applied.},

The modelling results, i.e. projections from 2001 to 2021, are discussed in terms of agricultural employment, regional population, and economic trends. It is shown that by targeting Pillar 2 money to non-agricultural rural development measures instead of to farm investments, less favoured area or agrienvironmental schemes, the long-term trends in severe depopulation, ageing and deindustrialisation in the area can be alleviated but not avoided. Finally, some conclusions are drawn, both about the implications of the results for sustainability in C\&S, and in general for future sustainable rural development policy.},

Based on the survey method the study also reveals an unfavorable situation where the most efficient measures in rural programs are the most difficult to absorb hence less popular among beneficiaries, while those least efficient are easy and thus more popular, especially in less developed regions.

The analysis uses data from a large sample survey of farmers in South West England and the results indicate that CAP reform is not stimulating rapid agricultural restructuring, rather it appears to be reinforcing many existing trends towards diversification and an increasing polarisation between the largest and smallest farms. CAP reform is impacting unevenly on the farm community and different farming situations are associated with different types of reaction. Market signals may become a more powerful driver of farmer behaviour, in which case the 2003 reforms will have proved successful in providing farmers the freedom to farm without coupled subsidies. On the basis of the results presented in this paper though, only a minority of farmers seem both well placed and well disposed to exploit such opportunities.},

	abstract = {Further coordination and coherence of the EU funds and policies has been increasingly called for, implying that the territorial perspectives should be included as a major element in the future policies. In this paper, CAP modulation is considered in a framework of a regional development such that it compares the effects on modulation funds first, as they are allocated as income subsidies to farm related, diversified economic activities and second, as they are channeled from agriculture to increased regional investment demand. A rural-urban Social Accounting Matrix is used as a base year data for the CGE-model. The results suggest that transferring CAP payments from actual agriculture as income support to diversified activity does not promote rural development and economic activity measured at the regional level. Accordingly, traditional agriculture seems to be able to exploit the subsidies more efficiently. On the contrary, the investment shocks resulted in positive total impacts in terms of the gross regional domestic product and regional employment. However, the positive GDP impacts were greater in the urban area, thus suggesting possible agglomeration development.},

Gaps in European programme documents concerning the networks’ purpose and their evaluation led to a survey of the National Network Units being conducted in 2010. Besides investigating how these gaps are bridged nationally, the survey aimed to provide an overview of the development of the networks, of the initial experiences and challenges faced in running the networks, and to assess their potential impact. Empirical findings show that the networks probably support rural development (policies) and create added value. However, ways of demonstrating this impact in quantitative terms are lacking. Member states tend to stick closely to the specifications provided by the Commission and rarely go beyond them even if they are inadequate – even though this is legally possible. As a result, one purpose originally envisaged for the networks, namely to contribute to improving governance, is neglected. The paper provides proposals for modifying EC Regulations so as to enhance rural networks’ impact and points to the need for further theoretical research corroborating the networks’ value and increasing their effectiveness.},

The results do not confirm the theoretical hypothesis that landowners benefit a large share of the CAP subsidies. According to our estimates, farmers gain between 60\% to 95\%, 80\% to 178\% and 86\% to 90\% of the total value of coupled crop/animal, coupled RDP and decupled payments, respectively. The CAP subsidies are only marginally capitalised in land rents. Our results suggest that rental rates are more responsive to structural variables and show a strong time dependency, suggesting the presence of rigidities in the EU rental markets, which constraint the adjustment of land rents to market signals and thus reduce landowners' gains from the CAP.},

Using static and dynamic panel data estimators, we show that standard neoclassical drivers, like relative income and the relative labour share, represent significant determinants of the intersectoral migration of agricultural labour. Overall, CAP payments contributed significantly to job creation in agriculture, although the magnitude of the economic effect was rather moderate. We also find that pillar I subsidies exerted an effect approximately two times greater than that of pillar II payments.},

The study employs micro-data from the European Union Labour Force Survey and regional data from the Farm Accountancy Data Network. We differentiate among the different measures of farm payments, looking at the individual impact of Pillar 1 instruments, i.e. coupled and decoupled payments, and at those in Pillar 2, targeted at rural development. The main results suggest that total subsidies at the regional level are negatively associated with the out-farm migration of agricultural workers in the two New member states, Hungary and Poland, so that the CAP would seem to hinder the exit of labour from agriculture. Conversely, the non-significant results for the ‘old’ member states may be interpreted as the result of opposing effects of coupled payments and rural development support. The diverse impact of CAP on the likelihood of leaving agriculture in the four countries reflects the heterogeneity across European member states, due to different market and production structures, which does not allow a common and simple generalisation of the effect of the CAP on labour allocation.},

	abstract = {The study investigates the convergence of labour productivity in 204 NUTS2 regions of the EU-15 between 1995 and 2006. The main objective of our work was to assess whether and to what extent European Union (EU) policies (Regional Policy and the Common Agricultural Policy) have been effective in promoting economic growth and fostering the process of convergence of EU regions. These policies can have an asymmetric spatial impact, even if some concrete steps have been taken to avoid an excessive concentration of costs or beneﬁts. To verify the effects of EU policies we compare different scenarios: with/without EU policies. Under a methodological proﬁle, we adopt the Solovian model proposed by Mankiw et al. (1992). For the estimates we used an econometric approach based on spatial ﬁlters with characteristics similar to Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) in order to obtain consistent estimates of both the convergence parameters β and the impact of the conditioning variables, policy measures in particular. Our technique allows the estimation of different convergence rates for each region and management of both the presence of spatial spillovers and structural differences in the regional economies. The results indicate that global convergence rates are comparable to those obtained in some other studies, while local coefﬁcients help to interpret the regional growth paths in a more realistic way. Finally, we utilise a quasi-experimental design, the Regression Discontinuity, for comparing the results of policy interventions, in terms of regional β-convergence rates, with a ‘counterfactual’ scenario.},

	url = {https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/43640},
	abstract = {In this paper we investigate the impacts of
abolishing the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for the post-2013 European Union (EU) financial perspective and the impacts of re-investing the released funds on research and development (R\&D;).
We apply a linked system of models to analyze the impacts for the EU member states. The linked system consists of five land-use sector models (agriculture, forestry, urban area, tourism and transport infrastructure),
which are connected to a macro-econometric
model. Additionally, a land cover model is used to disaggregate land use countries to a 1 km² grid.
Three scenarios are analysed. In the “baseline” currently decided policies are assumed to be continued until 2025. In the “tax rebate” scenario agricultural support (first pillar) is removed, and the member states’ contributions to EU lowered. In the “R\&D; investments” scenario agricultural support is also removed, and the released
funds are used to increase general R\&D; efforts in the EU.
We find that in both liberalization scenarios, agricultural producer prices drop compared to the baseline. Agricultural production drops too, but less so in the “R\&D; investment” scenario due to productivity gains resulting from the increased R\&D; spending. In some countries, the productivity gains totally offset the negative impact of liberalisation on agricultural production. Smaller agricultural production implies less agricultural land use, and the more so in the “R\&D; Investment” scenario where productivity increases.
The fall in agricultural production and prices negatively affects economic activity and households’ purchasing power, but the reduced direct taxation compensates this  effect and results in a GDP gain of 0.53\% and 0.8 million additional jobs. In “R\&D; investment” GDP gain reaches 2.57\% and yields 2.95 million additional jobs in EU in 2025. The GDP, consumption and employment gains in the “R\&D; Investment” scenario widely exceed
the losses in the agriculture sectors.
The analysis indicates that if no external effects of agriculture are considered, then the CAP is an inefficient use of tax money, and that a considerable contribution to reaching the goals of the Lisbon agenda would be achieved if the same amount of money was instead invested in R\&D;.},

	abstract = {Core objectives for rural development support for the programming period 2007-2013 are: (1) improving the competitiveness of agriculture and forestry, (2) improving the environment and the countryside, and (3) improving the quality of life in rural areas and encouraging diversification of economic activity. Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 includes a clearer targeting towards smaller and micro - enterprises to sustain job opportunity in rural areas. For this programming period a minimum funding of 10\% of the total EU contribution has been withheld by the Council Regulation for measures concerning the quality of life and diversification of the rural economy outside agriculture and forestry. In spite of it the EU's Court of Auditors has concluded that Rural development policy in Europe is ineffective because continues to allow member states to adopt a predominantly sector approach with a primary focus on the agricultural sector. Taking into account the variety of regions in Europe and the different situations at national level, it is difficult to provide a single guideline to solve the problem. This paper deals with possible impact of Less Favorite Area payments on rural development. Special attention will be given to the role of LFA in maintenance of agricultural production that is desirable from environmental point of view and overcoming common rural problems like depopulation of rural areas. Using the case of Poland and Czech specific implementation of LFA payments rules will be compared (that to be done with respect to different rural structures between those two countries). Descriptive analysis of farm structures development patterns will be used to explain low economic effectiveness of LFA instrument. Similarly presentation of spatial distribution of LFA payment will be used to investigate its environmental effectiveness. Groups offarms that are major beneficiaries of LFA instrument are to be selected and compared with the objective one. It is expected that comparative analysis clarify the practical efficiency of LFA instrument in rural development. Finally, the conclusion concerned with future CAP is to be presented in respect of supporting regional rural development.},

The calculations are based on the specification and simulation of seven different farm models and on an analysis of the Austrian Integrated Administration and Control System data sets. The results of both analyses suggest redistribution effects in favour of less extensive farm management systems.

The analysis took into account the changes of the Common Agricultural Policy in terms of goals and the directions of its evolution. In the paper the alterations in land, labour and capital resources of Polish agriculture were also analysed. It has been established that funds coming from the Community budget allowed Polish agriculture to adjust to the requirement of new environment. Integration into the European Union has created good conditions to dynamic development of the agri-food sector as a whole. Acceleration of the modernization and restructuring processes of Polish farms has taken place. These developments have resulted in a reduction in the total number of farms (by 52\%) at the simultaneous rise in their average area (by 78\%). Union financial measures have also influenced on generational renewal amongst farms managers. The funds considerably enhanced farmers’ incomes, which increased by 156\%, thus promoting expenditure on investments. As a result the improvement of technical utilities of farms has been achieved. Consequently, labour productivity growth in Polish agriculture has also been recorded. A wide range of measures within the framework of the Common Agricultural Policy enables to overcome many obstacles of the rural areas in Poland. It also creates possibilities to take advantage of naturally occurring assets in order to effectively compete on the external market.},

No evidence emerges to indicate any impact of the measures on farm income, employment or partial productivities. Conversely, participation in the selected policy schemes resulted initially in a productivity increase and, subsequently, in enhanced farm performance. We argue that participation in the growth-oriented measures gave rise to a process of capital deepening that, in turn, elicited a productivity increase and, eventually, positive growth rates in farm performance. The estimated variations in capital intensity signal that the measures resulted in the activation of channels that are expected to positively aﬀect farm performance after a time lag.},

A circular bioeconomy implies a more efficient resource management of bio-based renewable resources by integrating circular economy principles into the bioeconomy. These ideas have been well received at industry level since they are deemed to foster cost reductions, innovation and competitiveness. While recent scientific literature has dwelt on sustainability-related circular business models, empirical research on company-level implementation is only just emerging. Our study contributes to addressing this research lacuna by seeking answers to two questions: 1. How do small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) propose, create and deliver, and capture value through circular bioeconomy business models?; and 2. What are the business challenges and opportunities related to the operationalization of such business models? To this end, we employed content analysis on interview data gathered from managers in Finnish SME companies from the field of packaging, textiles, composite materials, cosmetics and pharmaceutical products. We outlined the main business model archetypes, and identified the key characteristics that enable value capture and delivery for various stakeholders. The contribution of this study is duly two-fold. From the perspective of a theoretical contribution, we expand and refine the conceptualization of sustainable circular bioeconomy and related business models. In addition, based on our findings, we provide insights and recommendations for researchers and policy-makers to advance the sustainability transition to a circular bioeconomy in the context of the forest-based industry, and for the management of SMEs to reflect on company viability and growth.},

On the basis of graph, social network and similarity measure theory, an approach is designed which compares every business model instances of a data set with each other. The paper comes up with a matching score in order to determine whether two business models are connected contentwise within a cluster or not. The plotting of the resulting matching scores leads to a visually based determination of a meaningful matching score which bonds two business models together or not. The elaborations result in four e-mobility service clusters: Dataand-software-driven-, brokering-, transportation- and energy supply-based business models.

Methods: The ScienceDirect, Wiley Online Library, Taylor and Francis Online, SpringerLink, AgECON, and Emerald databases were searched systematically. A complementary search in Google Scholar was also carried out. Peer-reviewed studies published between 2000 and 2019 were identiﬁed using multiple search terms. Data about four types of multipliers (output, employment, income, and value-added multipliers) were extracted. Results: Twenty-four papers ﬁt the criteria, allowing for a qualitative assessment only. Sixteen papers found unambiguously that an increase in demand for local food had a directly positive impact on local economies in some way; one paper found no impact at all. The papers were classiﬁed into three groups based on their focal areas: marketing channel-focused, farm enterprise-focused, and scenario/impact analysis-focused studies. In terms of the methods of analysis, three major approaches were identiﬁed: input–output models, assessments of descriptive statistics, and econometric analyses. Considerations related to the potential overestimation of current approaches are presented. Conclusions: The existence of employment and income multipliers seems to be more evident, while the impacts of output- and value-added multipliers depend more on the actual context. Research gaps are also identiﬁed.},

	abstract = {Unexceptionally all metropolitan areas throughout the world are surrounded by peri-urban areas that are neither urban nor rural in the conventional sense. Peri-urban areas are transition spaces, where the changes in different land uses are incessantly occurring. Determining the boundaries of these areas are critical to develop appropriate policies to manage and preserve them. The perpetual transition in peri-urban landscapes makes the boundary demarcation of these areas highly difficult. This paper aims to answer the question of what the most suitable methodological approach to demarcate peri-urban areas is. In order to address this question, the study undertakes a systematic review of the relevant literature. The findings show that a generic method does not exist to demarcate peri-urban areas as characteristics of peri-urban areas are not uniform across the globe. This paper advocates that techniques for peri-urban demarcation should be geographically specific, and in every case the regional and local contexts–e.g., political system, institutional arrangement, societal characteristic, environmental qualities, and economic drivers that underpin the peri-urban development—should be considered. The study provides insights to policymakers in order to determine peri-urban boundaries by tailoring available peri-urban demarcation techniques to their regional and local contexts.},

	abstract = {The digital revolution and the ongoing dissemination of mobile phones carry several prospects for smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. Food insecurity and low dietary quality remain major issues among African smallholders. Mobile phones could potentially facilitate access to food markets and thus improve food security and nutrition, but research on such types of effects remains scarce. In this study, we analyze whether mobile phones improve dietary quality among pastoral communities in Northern Kenya. We use six rounds of household panel data covering the period between 2009 and 2015. During this period, mobile phone ownership in the sample increased from less than 30\% to more than 70\%. Regression models with household fixed effects allow robust estimation while reducing potential issues of unobserved heterogeneity. The estimates show that mobile phone adoption and use are positively and significantly associated with dietary diversity. The effects are particularly large for frequent mobile phone users. We also examine the underlying mechanisms. Mobile phone use improves dietary diversity mainly through better access to purchased foods. These results encourage the promotion of mobile phone technologies as a valuable tool for nutritional improvements, especially in remote rural settings with poor access to food markets.},

Discussion includes accounting for differential impacts of COVID-19 on demand for food across sociodemographic characteristics, and several high-level issues and observations related to where and how consumers shop and what they buy. My own thinking leads me to conclude that demand-side factors will account for most of the changes we see in retail food market. These demand-side effects will be dominated by income effects, the opportunity cost of time, and longer planning horizons on the part of consumers.},

Given the prevalence of poverty in rural areas, nonfarm income has been credited with helping farmers to survive. But the observed shrinking of rural areas has also raised the question of whether off-farm work is pulling farmers permanently away from farming. This paper explores the impact of farmer characteristics on the decision to work off-farm in developing countries where this phenomenon has been largely neglected. A review of theory and prior empirical work suggests four main hypotheses which we test empirically. The results suggest that while some farmer characteristics appear to be universal, others appear to be country- or culture-specific.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the rationale for pursuing environmental objectives by reducing food loss and waste (FLW). The main thrust of the literature on this issue is that FLW reduction can make a major contribution to making food systems more sustainable. Using a stylized analytical framework, we find that reducing FLW always improves resource use efficiency for land and water, and reduces the amount of greenhouse gases (GHG) emitted per unit of food consumed. However, whether the actual environmental outcome is improved will depend on where environmental damage and FLW reduction occur, and the way price transmission connects these along the food supply chain. We find that, while a food waste reduction at the consumer level always improves the environmental outcome, this is not guaranteed when reducing losses from farm to retail. We thus derive a condition linking the price transmission mechanism and the environmental impact of a loss reduction. Simulating environmental outcomes based on a range of parameter values found in the literature, we find that reducing losses at or close to the farm level can increase the aggregate amount of GHG emissions, and therefore focusing on reducing consumer waste is more effective in reducing emissions. As for reducing natural resource use, both loss and waste reductions reduce the amount of land and water use, but effectiveness is reduced by heterogeneity in environmental impact. Relative to loss reductions, effectiveness of a waste reduction is amplified if there are environmentally damaging losses upstream in the value chain, but also dampened by vertical heterogeneity of sourcing along a value chain. The paper makes the case that more targeted instruments may be better suited to address typically local water scarcity and land use and degradation issues.},

The contribution of livestock industry including poultry and fish is increasing substantially in GDP of country which accounts for {\textgreater}40\% of total agricultural sector and {\textgreater}12\% of GDP. This contribution would have been much greater had the animal by-products been also efficiently utilized. Efficient utilization of by-products has direct impact on the economy and environmental pollution of the country. Non-utilization or under utilization of by-products not only lead to loss of potential revenues but also lead to the added and increasing cost of disposal of these products. Non-utilization of animal by-products in a proper way may create major aesthetic and catastrophic health problems. Besides pollution and hazard aspects, in many cases meat, poultry and fish processing wastes have a potential for recycling raw materials or for conversion into useful products of higher value. Traditions, culture and religion are often important when a meat by-product is being utilized for food. Regulatory requirements are also important because many countries restrict the use of meat by-products for reasons of food safety and quality. By-products such as blood, liver, lung, kidney, brains, spleen and tripe has good nutritive value. Medicinal and pharmaceutical uses of by-product are also highlighted in this review. Waste products from the poultry processing and egg production industries must be efficiently dealt with as the growth of these industries depends largely on waste management. Treated fish waste has found many applications among with which the most important are animal feed, biodiesel/biogas, dietectic products (chitosan), natural pigments (after extraction) and cosmetics (collagen). Available information pertaining to the utilization of by-products and waste materials from meat, poultry and fish and their processing industries has been reviewed here.},

	abstract = {Forecasts of crop yield are an important tool for a variety of stakeholders, but most studies produce large-scale, late-season yield forecasts that are not appropriate for farmers. Farmers require forecasts of crop yield mid-season and at fine spatial resolutions to guide site-specific adaptive crop management practices. This study created empirical random forest models to forecast cotton yield mid-season at three different spatial resolutions: 30 m, field, and farm aggregation. Large yield mapping datasets from 14 different seasons were utilised to build the model across 68 different fields from six large cotton farms in eastern Australia. A generic conceptual framework is proposed to empirically model crop yield. This topsaw framework represents the spatial and temporal factors that drive yield, including topography (t), organisms (o), plant measurements (p), soil (s), agronomy/management (a), and weather (w). In this study, the specific predictor variables to represent these driving factors of yield included elevation (t), Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, Enhanced Vegetation Index, MODIS Evapotranspiration (p), gamma radiometrics grid, clay content digital soil map (s), rainfall data, and growing day degrees (w). Forecasts of cotton yield increased in accuracy as the spatial resolution of predictions became coarser. Using a leave-one-year-out cross-validation, cotton yield could be forecasted to an accuracy of 0.42 Lin's Concordance Correlation Coefficient (LCCC) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 2.11 bales ha−1 at 30 m resolution. This improved to a 0.63 LCCC and 1.72 bales ha−1 RMSE at the field resolution, and a 0.65 LCCC and 0.77 bales ha−1 at the aggregation-scale. As the developed approach solely relied on publicly available predictor variables, there is an opportunity to apply this to any cotton field in Australia, and over a much larger area. Overall, this study is an important step in building an operational approach to forecast mid-season cotton yield at fine spatial resolutions, and has the potential to improve production, input use efficiency, and profitability for individual growers and the Australian Cotton Industry as a whole.},

Furthermore, much of the related literature examines the effect of subsidies only on technical efficiency (TE). We examine the effect of different types of subsidies on the different components of total factor productivity (TFP) in Slovenian agriculture over the period 2006–2013. We first estimate a Random Parameter Stochastic production frontier model. Then, based on the estimates of this model, we calculate and decompose the TFP index into TE, scale efficiency and technological change. Third, we apply combined difference-in-difference and a matching estimator to examine the effect of investment, less favoured area (LFA) and agri-environmental (AE) subsidies on the different components of TFP. In our case, these subsidies are found to have no significant effect on either TFP or on its components.},

We use a classification of published articles for the years 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016 in the leading journals in the field: Sociologia Ruralis, Rural Sociology, and Journal of Rural Studies. We found striking differences in the publication policy of the three journals regarding methods applied. Sociologia Ruralis primarily accepts articles of a qualitative nature, and this has scarcely changed over the years. Rural Sociology, on the other hand, accepts mostly quantitative articles, and this has also been quite stable over time. The Journal of Rural Studies has traditionally been oriented towards qualitative research, but, in recent years, mixed method approaches play a visible role (around 20\% in 2016). JRS is also the only journal that shows a sharp increase in papers of non-Western origin, with an emphasis on quantitative methods but not on mixed methods. The overall conclusion is that the rural research context offers considerable scope for a broader and increased application of mixed methods, and this merits greater attention among rural journals.},

We develop a macrolevel analytical framework to investigate the impact of obesity prevalence on average life expectancy, the trade-off between health expenditure and obesity prevalence, and the differential effect of obesity prevalence by gender, and apply this framework to cross country national data using a panel data of 183 countries for the years 2007 to 2014. The empirical analysis shows that the average life expectancy is a concave function of obesity prevalence, and an increase in obesity prevalence increases average expected life expectancy with low obesity levels. While obesity is a significant problem in developed countries, its impact on average life expectancy is partially mitigated by health expenditure. Underweight and lack of health expenditure in developing countries are even more severe problems. The marginal benefit of health expenditure in a low obesity country (highly correlated with underweight) has a larger impact on life expectancy relative to that in a high obesity country. A part of the longer life expectancy of women is related to better average nutritional state and less vulnerability to obesity. The results are consistent over three macromeasures of the longevity of life—average life expectancy, adult mortality rate, and healthy life expectancy.},

We use dynamic modelling, based on a micro-data panel of Italian farms for the period 2008–2014, allowing for endogeneity, simultaneity bias, and omitted variables. In line with previous studies and economic expectations, we ﬁnd that decoupled direct payments provide the highest contribution to agricultural incomes, followed by agri-environmental payments and onfarm investment subsidies. Coupled payments have no signiﬁcant impacts on farmers’ income. Generally, for all analysed Common Agricultural Policy measures, large farms beneﬁt from greater transfer eﬃciency levels compared with medium and small farms. These diﬀerences among instruments and across farms suggest that policy-participation costs may play a pivotal role, together with the economic structure of farms, in determining the income transfer eﬃciency of CAP policies.},

This study was carried out at commune level, and used a series of variables to describe the socioeconomic development levels of communes, natural conditions for farming and the agrarian structure. These characteristics were compared with the farmers’ activity in accessing EU funds allocated to farm modernization. The Hellwig’s synthetic development indicator was used to represent complex phenomena. A strong relationship was found to exist between the implementation of co-financed investments and the agrarian structure at local level. Other factors proved to be insignificant. This suggests that the agricultural development path is somewhat independent from socioeconomic and environmental conditions.},

This finding is robust to the inclusion in the analysis of different variables that may affect regional governance. Likewise, the observed effect of neighbouring regions does not depend on the specific dimension of governance considered, the spatial weights matrix used to describe the spatial linkages between the European regions, or the econometric specification employed to capture the nature of spatial spillovers. The results also show that policy innovations related to governance spread from regions with high and intermediate levels of quality of government.},

Aiming at reaching a deeper understanding of communication of sustainable tourism in urban and rural spaces through the ‘eyes of the users’, the paper identifies different types of influencers on Instagram and how they are associated with tourism destinations. By focusing on the role of social media influencers in shaping destination images, the paper analyzes the use of the hashtag \#sustainabletourism on Instagram from January 2012 to January 2019. A mixed-method approach has been used to map both the evolution of sustainable tourism-related content and a typology of influencers. The results show that different kind of Instagram’s influencers differently generate engagement according to tourism destinations. Findings are used to derive insights for policy makers, planners and organizations by inferring how influencers can act as central hubs in connecting urban and rural environments, seen as tourism destinations, and in raising awareness of their sustainable attributes.},

In a first step, we propose an extended and multidimensional typology defining rurality, using a set of spatial and industrial variables, from which we obtain 15 rural/urban types of MRCs. In a second step, we test for significant differences between these types, for a wide range of variables measuring firm performance, internal firm capacities and the regional economic competitiveness. Our results indicate that rurality may be too broad a concept to categorize the economic situation of “non-urban” regions. We do observe significant differences between regions, but not always on an urban-rural division. We show that geographic remoteness and the nature of the regions’ industrial base may be more useful to characterize their particular economic environment to the economic performance of SMEs.},

	abstract = {Economists typically celebrate productivity growth as the chief way to improve living standards. They also advocate that particular cities and regions strive to be as productive as possible to attract business and increase employment. However, while productivity growth may reduce costs, improve quality, or lead to innovation and new products, if demand is insufficiently elastic, labor demand may decrease, reducing employment in that location. In other words, places experiencing the most productivity growth may face some unintended consequences, such as weakening of local labor markets. In this paper, we study county-level effects of productivity growth and productivity levels in the computer and electronic product manufacturing industry (NAICS334), the goods sector (excluding NAICS334) and in the services sector on total employment growth, employment growth in major sectors, income and earnings growth. The results suggest that productivity growth generally suppresses job growth but has boosting effects on earnings and, to a lesser degree, on per-capita income, although there is considerable variation across geographies and specific outcomes.},

The research hypothesized that biophilic design and planning promote connectedness with nature and are positively related to pro-environmental and more sustainable values and behaviors. The contemporary city asserts the need for new paradigms and conceptual frameworks for reconfiguring the relationship between the urban environment and the natural environment. In order to understand whether biophilic design, planning, and policies can meet the global challenges regarding the future existence on earth of humans, focus groups were conducted to investigate how people\&rsquo;s relationship with the built-up space and the natural landscape is perceived, and to what extent the inclusion of nature and its patterns at various levels of urban planning meets people\&rsquo;s expectations. The results suggest that biophilic design and planning can be considered a useful paradigm to deal with the challenges that are posed by the city of the future, also in terms of sustainability, by reinterpreting and enhancing the human\&ndash;nature relation in the urban context.},

A rich variety of regional policy measures have been launched over the years. However, despite this and a heavy expansion of welfare undertakings a significant depopulation has taken place. Also the first generation of EU Structural Funds show very weak structural impacts on development of employment and population. Against this background the need is highlighted to reconsider fundamental principles behind policymaking. The paper argues for more active efforts to change attitudes and behaviour among economic actors and households in order to achieve stronger structural impacts. As a critical part of this the elaboration is suggested of new proactive strategies aiming at more sustainable spatial structures of welfare distribution and job opportunities in this type of increasingly vulnerable peripheries.},

The initial hypothesis is that, in spite of the integration process, the agricultural productivity does not converge to the same stationary level. Additionally, we try to identify the decisive factors affecting such productivity growth. Productivity related information comes from Cambridge Econometrics database for a set of 125 EU-15 regions in the period 1985-2004. The methodology used consists in traditional beta convergence regressions. The difficulties with cross-sectional estimations require the use of panel data techniques for a better estimation of the speed of convergence. The main results show that convergence occurs to different stationary states and the productivity growth is related to the loss of agricultural employment and to the levels of investment. Moreover, subsidies of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) do not have so far an important role in the productivity growth. It seems that the solution to improve agricultural efficiency is not to increase the market support. CAP instruments should be redefined to stimulate sector investment.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to make an evaluation of CAP contribution to landscape management in Bulgarian economy of rural areas. To sum up, landscape is a non-commodity output produced as direct or indirect outcome of the activities operating in a particular area and it is valued by society for its functions (use and non use values, ecological, recreational, cultural etc). Due to this complex nature, it produces second-order effects that are captured by the stakeholders in rural areas (farmers or others), and that generate potential markets for new activities. Therefore, through the generation of these effects, landscape contributes to boosting the economy of rural areas and is an important driver for the whole regional economy. The research reported in this paper was funded by the European Commission within the project “ Supporting the role of the Common agricultural policy in Landscape valorisation: Improving the knowledge base of the contribution of landscape Management to the rural economy” (CLAIM), 7th Framework Programme, contract n. 222738 (www.claimproject.eu). The Rural Development Programmes of the current period (2007-2013) support measures that can have an added value for this new perspective of the policy. Some of them such as the agrienvironmental payments and the measures designed for less favoured areas can have direct and indirect effects in the provision of landscape. Additionally they have effects in delivering landscape as environmental public good, playing also an important role in terms of financial allocation in the current Rural Development Programme. The analysis of existing specific measures targeted at local level connected to the landscape allow to distinguish supporting potential landscape-related activities and it’s role at the economy of rural areas.},

Its mode of intervention relies less on direct aid more on offering support to projects by federating regions and Member States to promote activities and actions in favour of the living environment in rural areas. However another aspect of EU intervention, the policy of cohesion, also concerns rural areas. The impact of these two aspects of EU intervention on the development of rural areas seems limited, only imperfectly addressing the contemporary reality of rural development. A dual approach is required in order to align the actions of the current programs and develop them further: on the one hand, with regards to the first pillar of the CAP and the spatial dynamics of the agricultural sector; on the other hand, with regards to social actions and regional development which affects the city as much as the countryside.},

Using both geographically weighted regression (GWR) and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, the paper observes the relationship between participation in Measure 214 programs and the region's socioeconomic structure through the examination of agriculturally related factors. In our analysis, GWR demonstrates the spatial dynamics and impact of Measure 214 on the region's economy. The GWR model illustrates regions with vibrant spatial patterns, as evaluated by parameter estimates and clarified through explanatory variables. Moreover, the GWR model performs better than the OLS model, as calculated by lower Akaike index AICc and higher adjusted R Squared (adjusted R2) values, reduced spatial autocorrelation of residuals, and higher F values from Analysis of Variance ( ANOVA). The results also suggest that non-participating communities, although influenced by the wave of industrial development, show a different pattern of economic development. The paper concludes that future funding of agrienvironmental and climate change initiatives under EU Measures will expand the observed pattern of organic production, agricultural employment, and integrated husbandry systems and provide further opportunities for sustainable development.},

The analysis of the drivers of regional growth shows that the European Union Cohesion Policy has a positive influence on economic growth in all regions. However, its impact is stronger in the most socio-economically advanced areas and is maximised when its expenditure is complemented by Rural Development and Common Agricultural Policy funds. The top-down funding of the Common Agricultural Policy seems to be able to concentrate some benefits in the most deprived areas of the Union. This suggests that bottom-up policies are not always the best approach to territorial cohesion. Top-down policies may – in some cases – be effective in order to channel resources to the most socio-economically deprived areas. Territorial cohesion requires the flexible integration and coordination of both bottom-up and top-down approaches.},

	abstract = {Different forms of income diversification represent important strategies of farmers to either cope with the changing economic framework conditions or to valorise given territorial potentialities. Nevertheless, the decision to diversify economic activities on or off the farm will heavily depend on the agricultural business and household characteristics. Our study used a survey of 2154 farms from eleven European regions to identify distinct farm types in order to investigate differences regarding the willingness to diversify in the future. Two scenario situations with continuation (baseline) and without any market intervention (“No CAP”) were tested. A factor and cluster analysis depicted six farm types both previously described and novel. The typology proved validity across all case studies, whereas single types occurred more frequently under specific site conditions. The six farm types showed strong variations in the stated future diversification behaviour. Young farm households with organic production are most likely to diversify activities particularly on-farm, whereas farm types characterised by intensive livestock holding and also already diversified and part-time farm households are least likely to apply this strategy. Results have further shown that under hypothetical conditions of termination of economic support by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) an increasing share of farmers – throughout all types – would apply income diversification, mainly off-farm diversification, as a survival strategy.},

	abstract = {The economic sustainability of farm households is frequently dependent on the availability of off- farm employment. This paper uses farm-level data to examine the impact of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) direct payment scheme, farm household characteristics and agricultural market conditions on farm households’ labour allocation decisions in Ireland. Among other things, the hypothesis that decoupled direct payments induce farm household members to allocate more time to off-farm employment is tested. The analysis presented here suggests that decoupled direct payments are significantly and negatively associated with both the probability and amount of time allocated to off-farm work in the case of the farm operator. For married couples, the analysis finds a negative relationship between decoupled payments and the probability of both the farm operator and the spouse working in off-farm employment. Interestingly, decoupled payments have no significant relationship with the probability of the spouse only working in off-farm employment. This result corresponds to the finding of (El-Osta et al. 2008) and suggests that decoupled payments tend to play a very limited role in explaining the off-farm employment decisions of the spouse. At a time of increased volatility in farm incomes and uncertainty in agricultural policy, this analysis contributes to our understanding about the importance of off-farm labour in supporting farm household income. Furthermore, the analysis contributes to our understanding about the role of the farm spouse in contributing towards farm household income, the farm viability and the relationship between off-farm labour decisions and agricultural policy.},

The intentions and decisions taken by young farmers in Lithuania are analysed within the rural sustainability concept. The empirical analysis relies on the questionnaire survey. In order to disentangle the possible effects of the CAP support on the farming sustainability (as it is perceived by the young farmers), we consider payments for farm establishment and expansion along with support for advisory services. The results show that young farmers’ support system under the CAP has the strongest perceived effect on income support in Lithuania without significant differences across different groups of farmers. The effect on investments is significantly lower for crop farms if opposed to the other farming types. Still, the results also indicate that environmental awareness of Lithuanian farmers is rather low as the demand for such advisory services appeared to be relatively low. The relatively high demand for advisory services on the business plan preparation suggests low levels of business administration and marketing skills among the young farmers, which indicates the need for development of the social dimension.},

               growth in the number of farms providing holiday accommodation, which has gone to
               answer the tourism flows from other European countries that have increased
               significantly, particularly since 2009. The core purpose of this study was to
               estimate, through a quantitative approach, the main relationships between decoupled
               payments and other financial subsidies allocated by the European Union in the
               framework of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the growth of Romanian
               agritourism. The findings reveal that, over the 2007–2016 period, decoupled
               payments more than financial subsidies allocated under the second pillar of the CAP
               have acted to encourage the growth of agritourism in the Romanian countryside. This
               has corroborated the crucial role that direct payments and other financial subsidies
               have played in stimulating diversification in Romanian farms and, at the same time,
               reducing the levels of permanent emigration from rural villages as well.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {With the integration into the European Union (EU) in 2007, growth opportunities have arisen for Romania. In terms of rural area and agriculture, National Rural Development Programs (NRDPs) are implemented, through which funds are granted from the European Union and the Government of Romania, for the economic and social development of the rural area. In this context, entrepreneurial initiatives for rural development have been encouraged, and many SMEs were given the opportunity to be eligible for European funding. The NRDP 2014-2020 continues the efforts for rural development, through strategic objectives, allowing entrepreneurs to implement their business ideas and sustain the development of the rural communities. The paper aims to analyze how the European funding influences the development of rural entrepreneurship in Romania. The study will comprise an analysis of the existing results of the NRDP 2014-2020, referring to annual evaluation indicators of the project implementation (number of jobs created in supported projects, percentage of rural population targeted by local development strategies, etc.). The methodology focuses on interpretation of the latest statistical data from trusted sources, as well as analysis of the official documents and reports (e.g. NRDP 2014-2020 annual report). This paper will contribute with accurate results and discussions concerning the role of EU funds for the rural communities. Also, the study will describe some of the challenges that Romanian rural entrepreneurship still faces after implementation of European funding programs and unresolved issues.},

The analysis showed that on average funds did not contribute to the creation of new enterprises in Romanian rural communities in the period 2009–2014. By matching for covariates no diﬀerences were found between supported and unsupported communities regarding new enterprise creation. However, evidence was found that the higher the treatment intensity, the higher the number of newly established enterprises.

	abstract = {An important feature of many rural markets is the over-supply of labour. An insufficient number of jobs in rural areas is usually associated with the shortage of capital, companies, consumers and skilled workers, i.e. limited impact of the agglomeration effect. Additionally, in regions with structural changes in agriculture, the phenomenon of increased or hidden unemployment is visible. One of the important objectives of labour market policy in Poland was a promotion of employment, especially in peripheral, poor and agricultural territories. Along with the accession of Poland to the EU, both agricultural and cohesion policy instruments supported by the structural funds have also been aimed at resolving the problems of rural labour markets. They concerned mainly the diversification of agricultural activities, support of entrepreneurship, as well as development of knowledge and skills. The paper considers the barriers and challenges in increasing employment in rural Poland. In particular, the changes on local rural labour markets and the influence of relevant policy tools thereon have been studied. The study is based on the quantitative and qualitative analysis of the public statistics and information on the implementation of selected EU CAP and Cohesion Policy instruments in Poland from the period 2007-2014 and the literature of the subject. The study showed that, despite the favourable economic situation and the effects of projects aimed at creating and maintaining non-agricultural jobs in rural areas supported by the EU founds, the rural employment rate and the number of people employed in agriculture did not increase significantly. In this context, the paper provides the explanation of limited improvements in terms of rural employment and policy offers recommendations in this area.},

Also, individual technologies have their own process configurations and operating parameters which may affect the yield and composition of the desired end product. All these require extensive study of the composition of the food wastes followed by their effective pre-treatments, judicial selection of the technological parameters and finally optimization of not only the process configurations but also in relation to the input food waste material.

	abstract = {The Special Accession Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development (SAPARD) was a pre-accession instrument, created and implemented by the European Union since 1999 and aimed at providing logistical support to applicant countries from Central and Eastern Europe. The programme had two main components: providing non-refundable financial assistance, by stimulating regional economic growth and development and, at the same time, it was directed at implementing certain management systems that matched the development policies of the EU. The effects triggered by the implementation of the SAPARD Programme in Romanian tourism were assessed in the past years from various quantitative perspectives (number of projects, value of the granted funding), but the regional economic impact generated strictly by this programme hasn’t yet been explicitly and unequivocally pointed out. From this standpoint, the previous research has been mainly focused on pre/post implementation comparisons of the GDP and of the unemployment rate. On a national level, the Suceava county stands out in terms of the large number of SAPARD projects funded through the Measure 3.4 – The development and diversification of economic activities to generate multiple activities and alternative income, thus leading to an increasing number of boarding houses in rural areas and, at the same time, fostering the qualitative development of the tourism supply in the area. From our point of view, an analytical approach of the multiplying effect generated by the SAPARD Programme would start from the thorough measurement of the economic changes that have occurred locally, in relation to the weight of the absorbed grants. The preliminary results arrived at in less than 5 years since the suspension of this funding source pinpoint a rather insignificant contribution of these funds to the local economy. The lack of experience of the parties involved in the system, bureaucracy and the migration of the non-refundable money are the most probable causes of the selection and implementation of projects that were rather unsustainable and inadequate in terms of quality.},

The programs appear to have the expected result and the positive effects on job creation may help to slow the depopulation of rural areas. However, within agriculture, horticultural farms outperform all other types in terms of hired paid labor, while the primary agricultural area of Wielkopolska-Śląsk also spends more on hire paid labor than other regions. Future analysis with disaggregated data is necessary to better measure the CAP effects on hired paid labor implying job creation.},

As a second step an input-output analysis estimates the employment effects of a hypothetical redistribution of agricultural subsidies to other sectors. The results show a decrease of 45,000 work places in the primary sector and an increase of 12,000 jobs in other sectors. But in all a decrease of 33,000 work places would be the result under the assumption of a constant volume of overall production. Due to the low income level in the primary sector public payments for agriculture seem to be a relatively cheep possibility to reach the highest possible level of employment with the side effects of keeping settlement in peripheral regions and maintaining the landscape.},

This study deals with the evaluation of rural employment creation strategies of selected member states or regions within them. We did this by analysing the degree of rurality, labour market characteristics and chosen agricultural sector characteristics. We applied the cluster analysis and compared clusters in chosen indicators in within and in between. Our study highlights the fact that specific settings of individual Rural Development Programmes of member states and regions related to rural employment creation correspond to the level of their development and the respective needs of agribusiness and rural areas. In general, within clusters we noticed great heterogenity of indicators used for the explanation of employment creation approach. We conclude that for the full explanation of policy settings of rural employment creation, we need to consider also the influence of unobservable factors, e.g. political lobby.},

	abstract = {Objective
To estimate the burden of cardiovascular disease within 15 European Union countries (before the 2004 enlargement) as a result of excess dietary saturated fats attributable to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).

Methods
A spreadsheet model was developed to synthesize data on population, diet, cholesterol levels and mortality rates. A conservative estimate of a reduction in saturated fat consumption of just 2.2 g was chosen, representing 1\% of daily energy intake. The fall in serum cholesterol concentration was then calculated, assuming that this 1\% reduction in saturated fat consumption was replaced with 0.5\% monounsaturated and 0.5\% polyunsaturated fats. The resulting reduction in cardiovascular and stroke deaths was then estimated, and a sensitivity analysis conducted.

Findings
Reducing saturated fat consumption by 1\% and increasing monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat by 0.5\% each would lower blood cholesterol levels by approximately 0.06 mmol/l, resulting in approximately 9800 fewer coronary heart disease deaths and 3000 fewer stroke deaths each year.

Conclusion
The cardiovascular disease burden attributable to CAP appears substantial. Furthermore, these calculations were conservative estimates, and the true mortality burden may be higher. The analysis contributes to the current wider debate concerning the relationship between CAP, health and chronic disease across Europe, together with recent international developments and commitments to reduce chronic diseases. The reported mortality estimates should be considered in relation to the current CAP and any future reforms.},

Our main finding is that evaluations do not seem to affect future policy to any discernible degree. This is the case for both national programmes and the Regulation itself, which seems to have evolved in response to external pressures. Partly, this may be because evaluations tend to give vague or too general recommendations. Moreover, evaluations seldom apply counterfactual analysis, often because of a lack of data, implying that results may be methodologically questioned. Lastly, evaluations, and RDPs, are hard to locate and seldom translated from their native languages, impairing the possibilities of learning from the experiences of others.},

	abstract = {Contemporary transformations of rural areas involve changes in land uses, economic perspectives, connectivity, livelihoods, but also in lifestyles, whereupon a traditional view of ‘the rural’ and, consequently, of ‘rural development’ no longer holds. Accordingly, EU’s 2007–2013 Rural Development policy (RDP) is one framework to incorporate aspects labelled as quality of life (QOL) alongside traditional rural tenets. With a new rendition of the RDP underway, this paper scopes the content and extent of the expired RDP regarding its incorporation of QOL, in order to better identify considerations for future policy making. Using novel methodology called topic modelling, a series of latent semantic structures within the RDP could be unravelled and re-interpreted via a dual categorization system based on RDP’s own view on QOL, and on definitions provided by independent research. Corroborated by other audits, the findings indicate a thematic overemphasis on agriculture, with the focus on QOL being largely insignificant. Such results point to a rationale different than the assumed one, at the same time reinforcing an outdated view of rurality in the face of the ostensibly fundamental turn towards viewing rural areas in a wider, more humanistic, perspective. This unexpected issue of underrepresentation is next addressed through three possible drivers: conceptual (lingering productionist view of the rural), ideological (capitalist prerogative preventing non-pecuniary values from entering policy) and material (institutional lock-ins incapable of accommodating significant deviations from an agricultural focus). The paper ends with a critical discussion and some reflections on the broader concept of rurality.},

	abstract = {Diversification of the farm income base represents a cornerstone of the European model of multifunctional agriculture (MFA) and rural development (RD) alongside the objectives of enhancing competitiveness and the sustainability of agriculture. A knowledge gap exists as to how farmers’ decisions to engage in non-agricultural activities, or to continue farming at all, is affected by landscape characteristics and the farm's location in the urban–rural system. This paper presents the results of research concerning the impact of spatial factors on diversification activities and farm abandonment. Based on a survey conducted among 147 farms in a case study area in Eastern Germany, spatially explicit data on farmers’ diversification activities and exit strategies were analysed using two spatial typologies that classify rural attractiveness and farm location on an urban–rural gradient. Results show that while rural attractiveness positively affects the farmers’ decision-making to diversify activities, the degree of urbanisation encourages farm holders to continue farming activity, i.e., the proximity and accessibility to urban consumer markets. Diversification rather seems to be associated with rurality and touristic development and not so much with the proximity to urban consumer markets.},

The initial hypothesis is that, in spite of the integration process, the agricultural productivity does not converge to the same stationary level. Additionally, we try to identify the decisive factors affecting such productivity growth. Productivity related information comes from Cambridge Econometrics database for a set of 125 EU-15 regions in the period 1985-2004. The methodology used consists in traditional beta convergence regressions. The difficulties with cross-sectional estimations require the use of panel data techniques for a better estimation of the speed of convergence. The main results show that convergence occurs to different stationary states and the productivity growth is related to the loss of agricultural employment and to the levels of investment. Moreover, subsidies of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) do not have so far an important role in the productivity growth. It seems that the solution to improve agricultural efficiency is not to increase the market support. CAP instruments should be redefined to stimulate sector investment.},

	abstract = {The process of change in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) from trade and market distorting measures to more neutral interventions has been long, but in this process the 2003 reform (the so-called Fischler reform) has been the most important step, leading to a more decoupled, and hence less market distorting, support (Oecd, 2004) and introducing the fully decoupled Single Farm Payment Scheme (SFP). In this paper, we estimate a model of operators’ off-farm labour participation from a panel of Italian COP farms drawn from the FADN. To this purpose we use a random effects probit model, thus controlling for unobserved heterogeneity. The results suggest that the effects of the reform on off-farm labour participation, if any, are weak. No variable directly related to the CAP reform is significant. These results are not in contrasts with the theoretical considerations, since the reform entails both wealth and substitution effects that tend to offset each other. Also, rigidities in the labour market tend to contrast adjustments to the changing conditions. Our results also suggest that changes in relative prices affect off-farm labour participation of farm operators, but that this effect depends on the labour intensity of the different crops. Therefore, the effects of the reform on off-farm labour participation can be due to these changes, but the role of the CAP reform in the changes in relative prices is uncertain, and out of the scope of this paper.},

	abstract = {Moving towards a more sustainable future requires concerted actions, particularly in the context of global climate change. Integrated assessments of agricultural systems (IAAS) are considered valuable tools to provide sound information for policy and decision-making. IAAS use storylines to define socio-economic and environmental framework assumptions. While a set of qualitative global storylines, known as the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs), is available to inform integrated assessments at large scales, their spatial resolution and scope is insufficient for regional studies in agriculture. We present a protocol to operationalize the development of Shared Socio-economic Pathways for European agriculture – Eur-Agri-SSPs – to support IAAS. The proposed design of the storyline development process is based on six quality criteria: plausibility, vertical and horizontal consistency, salience, legitimacy, richness and creativity. Trade-offs between these criteria may occur. The process is science-driven and iterative to enhance plausibility and horizontal consistency. A nested approach is suggested to link storylines across scales while maintaining vertical consistency. Plausibility, legitimacy, salience, richness and creativity shall be stimulated in a participatory and interdisciplinary storyline development process. The quality criteria and process design requirements are combined in the protocol to increase conceptual and methodological transparency. The protocol specifies nine working steps. For each step, suitable methods are proposed and the intended level and format of stakeholder engagement are discussed. A key methodological challenge is to link global SSPs with regional perspectives provided by the stakeholders, while maintaining vertical consistency and stakeholder buy-in. We conclude that the protocol facilitates systematic development and evaluation of storylines, which can be transferred to other regions, sectors and scales and supports inter-comparisons of IAAS.},

They can be used by scientists, policymakers and entrepreneurs to explore the challenges of global environmental change given an appropriate level of spatial and sectoral detail and systematic development.

The resulting five Eur-Agri-SSPs are titled (1) Agriculture on sustainable paths, (2) Agriculture on established paths, (3) Agriculture on separated paths, (4) Agriculture on unequal paths, and (5) Agriculture on high-tech paths. They describe alternative plausible qualitative evolutions of multiple drivers of particular importance and high uncertainty for European agriculture and food systems. The added value of the protocol-based storyline development process lies in the conceptual and methodological transparency and rigor; the stakeholder driven selection of the storyline elements; and consistency checks within and between the storylines. Compared to the global SSPs, the five Eur-Agri-SSPs provide rich thematic and regional details and are thus a solid basis for integrated assessments of agriculture and food systems and their response to future socio-economic and environmental changes.},

This paper addresses the need for methodological progress and testing of conceptual considerations, by extending the global shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs). We present a set of four European SSPs until 2100 and a novel method to develop qualitative stories for Europe equivalent to the global SSPs starting from an existing set of European scenarios. Similar to the global SSPs, the set includes a sustainable future with global cooperation and less intensive lifestyles (We are the World; Eur-SSP1); a future in which countries struggle to maintain living standards in a high-carbon intensive Europe (Icarus; Eur-SSP3); a world in which power becomes concentrated in a small elite and where Europe becomes an important player (Riders on the Storm; Eur-SSP4); and one where a lack of environmental concern leads to the overexploitation of fossil fuel resources addressed by technological solutions (Fossil-fuelled Development; Eur-SSP5). We conclude that the global SSPs are a good starting point for developing equivalent continental scale scenarios that, in turn, can serve multiple purposes. There are, however, methodological challenges related to the choice for equivalence and the exact methods by which scenarios are constructed that need to be tested further.},

	abstract = {In the future, the land system will be facing new intersecting challenges. While food demand, especially for resource-intensive livestock based commodities, is expected to increase, the terrestrial system has large potentials for climate change mitigation through improved agricultural management, providing biomass for bioenergy, and conserving or even enhancing carbon stocks of ecosystems. However, uncertainties in future socio-economic land use drivers may result in very different land-use dynamics and consequences for land-based ecosystem services. This is the ﬁrst study with a systematic interpretation of the Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs) in terms of possible land-use changes and their consequences for the agricultural system, food provision and prices as well as greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, ﬁve alternative Integrated Assessment Models with distinctive land-use modules have been used for the translation of the SSP narratives into quantitative projections. The model results reﬂect the general storylines of the SSPs and indicate a broad range of potential land-use futures with global agricultural land of 4900 mio ha in 2005 decreasing by 743 mio ha until 2100 at the lower (SSP1) and increasing by 1080 mio ha (SSP3) at the upper end. Greenhouse gas emissions from land use and land use change, as a direct outcome of these diverse land-use dynamics, and agricultural production systems differ strongly across SSPs (e.g. cumulative land use change emissions between 2005 and 2100 range from À54 to 402 Gt CO2). The inclusion of land-based mitigation efforts, particularly those in the most ambitious mitigation scenarios, further broadens the range of potential land futures and can strongly affect greenhouse gas dynamics and food prices. In general, it can be concluded that low demand for agricultural commodities, rapid growth in agricultural productivity and globalized trade, all most pronounced in a SSP1 world, have the potential to enhance the extent of natural ecosystems, lead to lowest greenhouse gas emissions from the land system and decrease food prices over time. The SSPbased land use pathways presented in this paper aim at supporting future climate research and provide the basis for further regional integrated assessments, biodiversity research and climate impact analysis. © 2016 The Authors.

	abstract = {Long-term scenario analyses can be powerful tools to explore plausible futures of human development under changing environmental, social, and economic conditions and to evaluate implications of different approaches to reduce pollution and resource overuse. Vulnerable ecosystems like the Baltic Sea in North-Eastern Europe tend to be under pressure from multiple, interacting anthropogenic drivers both related to the local scale (e.g. land use change) and the global scale (e.g. climate change). There is currently a lack of scenarios supporting policy-making that systematically explore how global and regional developments could concurrently impact the Baltic Sea region. Here, we present five narratives for future development in the Baltic Sea region, consistent with the global Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) developed for climate research. We focus on agriculture, wastewater treatment, fisheries, shipping, and atmospheric deposition, which all represent major pressures on the Baltic Sea. While we find strong links between the global pathways and regional pressures, we also conclude that each pathway may very well be the host of different sectoral developments, which in turn may have different impacts on the ecosystem state. The extended SSP narratives for the Baltic Sea region are intended as a description of sectoral developments at regional scale that enable detailed scenario analysis and discussions across different sectors and disciplines, but within a common context. In addition, the extended SSPs can readily be combined with climate pathways for integrated scenario analysis of regional environmental problems.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we analyse the drivers of farm structural change in the EU-27, applying a novel analytical framework in the ﬁeld of agricultural economics known as the multiplicative competitive interaction (MCI) model. MCI offers a more parsimonious speciﬁcation for estimating models of regional farm group shares compared to the often-applied Markov approach. The MCI framework enables farm group-speciﬁc equations, which are used to account for drivers speciﬁc to certain farm groups. The MCI framework explains farm group shares at the regional level taken from the Farm Structure Survey (FSS) using socio-economic variables from the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) and other databases for the period 1989–2013. We consider eight production specialisations and two size classes at the NUTS 2 regional level. The results indicate that the past farm structure explains approximately 36 per cent of the EU farm structure variation across regions and time, followed by natural conditions (16 per cent), agricultural prices (14 per cent), macroeconomic variables (9 per cent), subsidies (7 per cent), population (6 per cent) and agricultural income (6 per cent). Further, we have run a simulation experiment where we derived elasticities of structural change with respect to time-varying variables. The structural change appears to be the most elastic with respect to income and macroeconomic variables.},

The rise of the current digital culture coincides with longstanding scientific questions about why humans sometimes remember and sometimes forget, and why some individuals remember better than others2–6. Here we examine whether spontaneous attention lapses—in the moment7–12, across individuals13–15 and as a function of everyday media multitasking16–19—negatively correlate with remembering. Electroencephalography and pupillometry measures of attention20,21 were recorded as eighty young adults (mean age, 21.7 years) performed a goal-directed episodic encoding and retrieval task22. Trait-level sustained attention was further quantified using task-based23 and questionnaire measures24,25. Using trial-to-trial retrieval data, we show that tonic lapses in attention in the moment before remembering, assayed by posterior alpha power and pupil diameter, were correlated with reductions in neural signals of goal coding and memory, along with behavioural forgetting. Independent measures of trait-level attention lapsing mediated the relationship between neural assays of lapsing and memory performance, and between media multitasking and memory. Attention lapses partially account for why we remember or forget in the moment, and why some individuals remember better than others. Heavier media multitasking is associated with a propensity to have attention lapses and forget.},

Childless men are, compared to women, missing from gerontological, psychological, reproduction, and sociological research. These fields have mainly focussed on family formation and practices with the fertility intentions, history, and experience of older men being overlooked. Over the past 15 years, research literature on both involuntary childlessness and ageing has highlighted the paucity of material on men’s experience. Infertility research has shown that failure to fulfil the status of parenthood may lead to a complex form of bereavement and is a significant challenge to identity. In the past three decades, there has been an escalation in the research and general literature surrounding fathers, fathering and fatherhood. Recent research into contemporary grandparenting has highlighted the intricacy and importance of intergenerational relationships to grandfathers. Drawing on my auto/biographical PhD study, this piece examines how 14 self-defined involuntarily childless men managed non-fatherhood. The findings demonstrated the complex intersections between the men’s attitude to childlessness, fatherhood, and non-fatherhood across the life course. The actions and attitudes of the men as they negotiated the movement from pre-transitional to a post-transitional stance towards fatherhood, demonstrated the different strategies each adapted in order to negotiate their procreative remit. This study countered the stereotype that fatherhood is not important to men and challenges research that reports that men are not affected by the social, emotional, and relational aspects of involuntary childlessness.},

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to extensively report the implications of the global trend of declining fertility rates and an increasingly ageing population. The experiences of childless men are mostly absent from gerontological, psychological, reproduction, and sociological, research. These disciplines have mainly focussed on family formation and practices, whilst the fertility intentions, history, and experience of men have been overlooked. Not fulfilling the dominant social status of parenthood provides a significant challenge to both individual and cultural identity. Distress levels in both infertile men and women have been recorded as high as those with grave medical conditions. Design/methodology/approach The aim of this paper is to provide some insight into the affect involuntarily childless has on the lives of older men. This auto/biographical qualitative study used a pluralistic framework drawn from the biographical, feminist, gerontological, and life course approaches. Data were gathered from in-depth semi-structured biographical interviews with 14 self-defined involuntary men aged between 49 and 82 years from across the UK. A broad thematic analysis highlighted the complex intersections between involuntary childlessness and agency, biology, relationships, and socio-cultural structures. Findings Diverse elements affected the men’s involuntary childlessness: upbringing, economics, timing of events, interpersonal skills, sexual orientation, partner selection, relationship formation and dissolution, bereavement, and the assumption of fertility. The importance of relationship quality was highlighted for all the men: with and without partners. Quality of life was affected by health, relationships, and social networks. Awareness of “outsiderness” and a fear of being viewed a paedophile were widely reported. Research limitations/implications This is a study based on a small self-selecting “fortuitous” sample. Consequently care should be taken in applying the findings to the wider population. Originality/value Health and social care policy, practice and research have tended to focus on family and women. The ageing childless are absent and excluded from policy, practice, and research. Recognition of those ageing without children or family is urgent given that it is predicted that there will be over two million childless people aged 65 and over by 2030 (approximately 25 per cent of the 65 and over population). The consequences for health and social care of individuals and organisations are catastrophic if this does not happen.},

Background: There is little research exploring the desire for fatherhood, with most studies concentrating on couples in infertility treatment.

Methods: A qualitative approach was adopted. A convenience sample of 10 biologically childless men were recruited through the snowball method and interviewed individually. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and transcripts were then analysed using Grounded Theory. Results: A core category, ‘Lifescape’s of childless men: enduring anticipation and expectation in an uncharted world’, divided into three meta themes: Emotive Forces, Extant Agency, and Life Course. The desire for parenthood appeared to peak in the 30s, gradually reduced, but did not cease. The participants also revealed a sense of ‘outsiderness’ in familial, social, and work relationships. Conclusion: Involuntarily childless men reported similar experiences to those in, or who have had, infertility treatment. These included a sense of loss, depression, exclusion, isolation, and risk‐taking behaviour. Over the life course the men also found ways to adapt and reappraise their beliefs concerning themselves emotionally, psychologically and socially. To help understand this process, gender‐role therapy is presented as a possible approach for working with childless men.},

Participants read an article excerpt containing quotes from a researcher debunking a common misconception, such as the existence of lucky streaks in games of chance. They also read the perspective of someone who rejected the researcher in favor of personal experience, either in the form of a quote in the article from a relevant professional (e.g., a casino manager, Study 1) or a comment from a purported previous respondent with no clear expertise (Study 2). In both studies, conservatives, compared to liberals, evaluated the views of the scientist and the person rejecting the science as closer in legitimacy. Differences in evaluation of the science rejecter were mediated by conservatives' heightened intuitive thinking. By spotlighting how partisans evaluate nonscientific perspectives alongside science and by focusing on apolitical topics, these results bring new clarity to the debate on whether conservatives are more biased than liberals in attitudes towards science.},

	abstract = {Historic events such as wars and epidemics have been suggested as explanation for decreases in atmospheric CO2 reconstructed from ice cores because of their potential to take up carbon in forests regrowing on abandoned agricultural land. Here, we use a coupled climate–carbon cycle model to assess the carbon and climate effects of the Mongol invasion ({\textasciitilde}1200 to {\textasciitilde}1380), the Black Death ({\textasciitilde}1347 to {\textasciitilde}1400), the conquest of the Americas ({\textasciitilde}1519 to {\textasciitilde}1700), and the fall of the Ming Dynasty ({\textasciitilde}1600 to {\textasciitilde}1650). We calculate their impact on atmospheric CO2 including the response of the global land and ocean carbon pools. It has been hypothesized that these events have contributed to significant increases in land carbon stocks. However, we find that slow regrowth and delayed emissions from past land cover change allow for small increases of the land biosphere carbon storage only during long-lasting events. The effect of these small increases in land biosphere storage on global CO2 is reduced by the response of the global carbon pools and largely offset by concurrent emissions from the rest of the world. None of these events would therefore have affected the atmospheric CO2 concentration by more than 1 ppm. Only the Mongol invasion could have lowered global CO2, but by an amount too small to be resolved by ice cores.},

The goal of our study is to examine the evolution of food waste over the last several decades at the United States and global levels. We first review the methodologies that have been used to estimate the magnitude of food waste so that the quality of the data can be evaluated. Though with limitations, existing data generally show that for many regions of the world, including the United States, pre-consumer food loss and waste as a share of total supply has been stable in recent decades. However, the aggregate share wasted masks important changes over time. We provide some evidence that food waste has shifted downstream in recent decades, i.e., from producers and processors to retailers and consumers. Through a reflection on the trends in major socioeconomic factors, we hypothesize that this downstream shift has been driven by increases in household incomes, improvements in technology, and changes in culture and institutions.},

	abstract = {As a consequence of the UK leaving the EU (‘Brexit’) and after almost five decades of sharing the Common Agricultural Policy, its objectives and instruments, the UK is about to embark on a set of four national agricultural policies, one for each constituent country. Legislation for England, which accounts for more than 70 per cent of UK aggregate farm income, will provide for some continuity, such as agri-environmental schemes and multi-annual programming. However, there will be a radical reform of the income support system as direct payments are progressively scaled down over seven years, a move that has been widely advocated inside and outside government. Similar change within the CAP has been rejected by the EU as a whole. The diverging paths will provide a valuable and rare opportunity to compare policy approaches in what is really a massive field experiment. Careful monitoring should be capable of casting light on the impact that removing direct income payments has on issues such as production levels, farm household incomes, innovation and investment, structural change, succession and the social contributions made by the farm sector. This information could be of great relevance to the EU-27 if in the future it chooses to follow a similar path of reform.},

It does so in a period of socioeconomic turbulence caused by the financial and sovereign debt crises, the accession to the Union of countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the spread of anti-European rhetoric. In a first stage, regional indicators of support for and trust in the EU are calculated from the microdata of several Eurobarometer surveys. They confirm interesting changes in the regional distribution of citizens’ attitudes during the period analysed, which vary between the two indicators. In a second stage, these indicators are merged with data on regional growth to assess the impact of the latter on citizens’ perception of the EU. The results suggest that support for and trust in the EU are more widespread in regions with a dynamic economy. This positive impact of growth remains significant and sizeable after controlling for several economic characteristics of the region. However, the impact of regional growth on attitudes towards the EU is not the same in all regions. The effect of support and trust is more intense in regions with per capita income above the EU average.},

In Study 1, men’s fear of failing to meet masculine expectations predicted their support for aggressive policies (e.g., the death penalty), but not policies lacking aggressive features (e.g., affirmative action). Studies 2 and 3 utilized Google searches to assess the relationship between regional levels of PM and real-world electoral behavior. The use of search terms related to masculine anxieties correlated with Donald Trump’s vote share in the 2016 general election (Study 2) and, confirming preregistered predictions, with Republican candidates’ vote shares in 2018 congressional elections (Study 3).

	abstract = {Although human existence is enveloped by ideologies, remarkably little is understood about the relationships between ideological attitudes and psychological traits. Even less is known about how cognitive dispositions—individual differences in how information is perceived and processed— sculpt individuals' ideological worldviews, proclivities for extremist beliefs and resistance (or receptivity) to evidence. Using an unprecedented number of cognitive tasks (n = 37) and personality surveys (n = 22), along with data-driven analyses including drift-diffusion and Bayesian modelling, we uncovered the specific psychological signatures of political, nationalistic, religious and dogmatic beliefs. Cognitive and personality assessments consistently outperformed demographic predictors in accounting for individual differences in ideological preferences by 4 to 15-fold. Furthermore, data-driven analyses revealed that individuals’ ideological attitudes mirrored their cognitive decision-making strategies. Conservatism and nationalism were related to greater caution in perceptual decision-making tasks and to reduced strategic information processing, while dogmatism was associated with slower evidence accumulation and impulsive tendencies. Religiosity was implicated in heightened agreeableness and risk perception. Extreme pro-group attitudes, including violence endorsement against outgroups, were linked to poorer working memory, slower perceptual strategies, and tendencies towards impulsivity and sensation-seeking—reflecting overlaps with the psychological profiles of conservatism and dogmatism. Cognitive and personality signatures were also generated for ideologies such as authoritarianism, system justification, social dominance orientation, patriotism and receptivity to evidence or alternative viewpoints; elucidating their underpinnings and highlighting avenues for future research. Together these findings suggest that ideological worldviews may be reflective of low-level perceptual and cognitive functions.This article is part of the theme issue ‘The political brain: neurocognitive and computational mechanisms’.},

	abstract = {This study is an evaluation of the Common Agricultural Policy’s (CAP) impact on balanced territorial development (BTD) of rural areas across EU-28: socio-economic aspects. The main focus of the study is on territorial development of rural areas, which are investigated through the analysis of socio-economic aspects and social inclusion. The evaluation work starts with a causal analysis which intended to scope and select the CAP measures and instruments considered to have a direct impact on the general objective of BTD in rural areas. The work is then articulated around five evaluation criteria: effectiveness, efficiency, coherence, relevance, European added value. Several methods have been applied to gather and analyse both quantitative and qualitative information. Sixteen evaluation study questions have been answered by using quantitative methods such as input-output analysis, clustering, and statistical regressions, as well as qualitative methods, including case studies, literature review and the observation of development trends over the programming period. According to the evaluation study findings, the issues and needs faced by rural regions in the EU-28 are significant. The evaluation’s quantitative and case study findings indicate that the impact of the CAP in supporting BTD through the improvement of socioeconomic aspects and social inclusion varies according to the characteristics of the rural region and the policy mix applied. Pillar I instruments, in particular direct payments, have been found to positively impact regional employment and re-investment. Pillar II measures, some of which are specifically designed to address socio-economic issues, demonstrate also positive effects.},

	abstract = {Within the European Union, there is currently a vivid debate about the European Green Deal with its Farm to Fork Strategy and the related future design of the Common Agricultural Policy post 2020. This paper contributes to this debate by providing a clustering of German farmers analysing objective data (N = 812) using Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) as a crucial pre-requisite for an effective design and communication of future agricul­ tural policies. Accordingly, German farmers can be clustered into three different groups. The conventional growers are the oldest group of farmers, showing the highest land growth rate, and are characterized by a focus on traditional and politically subsidised activities. The versatile youngsters are rather young in age and the majority of them have completed some form of higher education. Their business profile is diverse. The third group of family-based farmers has the highest shares of family support within their farming business and consists mostly of dairy farmers. Policy and communication design needs to consider all these different profiles. Espe­ cially new and innovative programs could be developed and tested together with the versatile youngsters. Furthermore, aspects ensuring an effective and economically rewarding production of agricultural goods should be taken into account to offer a perspective for the conventional growers and for food security. Moreover, the family-based farmers constitute a promising target group for rural development programs.},

	abstract = {Government interventions in the agricultural sector have been historically justiﬁed by the existence of an income disparity between farmers and non-farmers. However, recent studies have found that such disparity is disappearing over time, particularly in the United States. This work oﬀers the ﬁrst longitudinal systematic assessment on the average income disparity between farm and non-farm units in the European Union, differentiating between old and new Member States. Using the EU-SILC dataset, both broad (having some farm income) and narrow (living mainly on agriculture) farm households are compared with a general sample of non-farm households and a more restricted sample of self-employed non-farm households. To control for household observable characteristics and time-constant unobserved factors, we use a ﬁxed eﬀects regression. Results suggest that the farm/non-farm income disparity has disappeared in the European Union unless we compare narrow farm households with all non-farm households: in this case, the former are more likely to be better oﬀ than the latter. A limited income disparity is found only in the case of new Member States for broad farm households only. Results are used to draw policy implications regarding the role of CAP in supporting farm income.},

	abstract = {With 76\% of the total main workforce in agriculture and more than 50\% small and medium landowning households, the village provides an important case study for understanding agrarian resilience. The conceptualisation of resilience has been majorly confined to a system or a territorial boundary. Agrarian resilience too is commonly assumed to be driven by forces within the agriculture and the rural. i.e. land ownership remains constant, the labour of the peasantry is spatially limited to agriculture, the capital is generated within agriculture and the networks and skills of the peasantry is also confined to agriculture. This has underscored the role of factors and processes working outside the agriculture in conceptualising agrarian resilience. While the primacy of the agrarian processes cannot be denied, there are often processes working outside an agrarian system that can also enable resilience. i.e. the rural workforce can diversify its labour outside agriculture in the urban non-farm sector, capital can also be generated from sources outside the agriculture. In this context, using the case study of a village dominated by small and medium landowning households in the Patiala district of Punjab in India, the paper shows that resilience is driven by processes both within and outside agriculture.},

	abstract = {Rural abandonment in mountainous regions is a habitual process that occurs in many countries and has socioeconomic and environmental implications. Land cover changes in Mediterranean mountains resulting from farming abandonment have been associated with certain processes of land degradation. This study employed Landsat satellite images for mapping the land cover changes in 1984 and 2007, south of the Iberian Range (region of Sierra de Albarracin, Teruel, Spain). A neural network classification was used to achieve sufficient land cover accuracy. The land cover change analysis revealed an expansion of forestland at the expense of pastureland and abandoned rainfed cropland. These changes were associated with demographic and economic shifts that resulted from a continuous process of rural abandonment. Population reduction has been the natural trend for a century, characterized by massive internal migrations to nearby cities. The dynamic displacement of the population centroid was used to identify the migratory processes in the last century. The primary sector and the associated secondary sector (farming and forestry) were diminished and resulted in a decrease in natural resource exploitation. Economic activity moved towards the tertiary sector, which focuses on rural tourism. The current socioeconomic scenario has unknown future implications for land cover dynamics and their associated ecosystem services values. Thus, monitoring of land cover changes and ecosystem services is required to promote sustainable development in an area that is highly dependent on the conservation of natural resources and ecological services.

Compared with previous researches that have paid major attention to the effect of labor migration on either crop production or livestock husbandry, this study considers the mediating role of crop production in predicting the effect of labor migration on livestock raising. Our econometric estimation based on a 2012 survey of 974 rural households in Chongqing, a mountainous region of China, showed the following. (1) The massive migration of rural labor force had led to significant increase in farmland abandonment and considerable changes in the pattern of livestock raising. (2) The livestock raising number per household began to differentiate, with the livestock system separating from the traditional crop-livestock system and becoming a specialized business. (3) In terms of the pathways through which rural labor migration exerts impact on livestock raising number, though the increased opportunity costs of rural labor greatly reduced farmers' willingness to raise livestock, the decoupling of the crop-livestock system partly alleviated the declining trend in the livestock raising number because of the availability of household labor force freed from cropping via farmland abandonment. These findings have important policy implications for rural development and agricultural restructuring in mountainous areas of China, and provide references for other developing countries.},

	abstract = {Since the Second World War, Poland has been undergoing an intensive process of transformation of the economic structure of rural areas, manifested, among other things, in the change in the occupational make-up of its inhabitants. The development of non-agricultural methods of management in rural areas has led to the emergence of multifunctional rural areas, where the role of agriculture as a source of income for the inhabitants is decreasing. There is a process of deagrarianisation of the economic structure, which has been indicated by many researchers as an unavoidable process, connected with the changes taking place in rural areas. One of the effects of this process are changes in rural settlement patterns. The aim of this article is to present the spatial effects of the deagrarianisation process in the Polish countryside, expressed in the changes in the rural settlement network. The authors used the statistical database of the Central Statistical Office (over 41 thousand records) to draw up the classification of rural areas by the nature of changes in population numbers in the period 1950-2011, which was compared with the research carried out as part of the Monitoring of Rural Development in Poland. The study confirmed that the factor behind the evolution of the rural settlement network is the process of decreasing agricultural demand for labour. As a consequence, there is a polarisation of localities into multifunctional rural localities, mainly headquarter villages and local government offices, and those with a predominantly agricultural function. On a supra-local scale, a process of polarisation of rural areas between a growing suburban population and a reducing peripheral location around large and medium-sized towns has been observed.},

	abstract = {This study is a systematic review of literature on the impact of international migration on rural areas. We examined this impact on six rural welfare indicators, including labour, livelihood activities, income, food security, land use, and rural development. We selected 44 papers from a pool of 1544 articles published from 2007 to 2018. We found that the impact of international migration on selected indicators varies and are highly contextspecific. The results point to the existence of heterogeneity in impacts, capable of creating a space of losers and winners among migrants and non-migrants households. The immediate impact is the loss labour effect, which leads to a process of feminisation of agriculture and the use of child labour. In the intermediate, this trend changes the power relationship in rural areas, briefly increasing the opportunities for the non-migrants household to control land. However, remittance helps the migrant household to move up in the income ladder, improving their food security, enabling the repurchase of land and causing a transition away from agriculture. We submit that international migration from developing countries could create a dynamic process of structural and functional transformations in rural areas, which may ultimately lead to a transition away from agriculture. We provide several policy implications and identified some research gaps for future studies.},

	abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression and path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.},
