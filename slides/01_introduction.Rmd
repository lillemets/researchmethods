## A story of drawing inferences

.small[
... a man walked into a Target outside Minneapolis and demanded to see the manager. He was clutching coupons that had been sent to his daughter, and he was angry, according to an employee who participated in the conversation.

“My daughter got this in the mail!” he said. “**She’s still in high school, and you’re sending her coupons for baby clothes and cribs?** Are you trying to encourage her to get pregnant?”

... The manager apologized and then called a few days later to apologize again.

On the phone, though, the father was somewhat abashed. “I had a talk with my daughter,” he said. “It turns out there’s been some activities in my house I haven’t been completely aware of. **She’s due in August. I owe you an apology.**”

## Scoring

Quantitative part gives you 50% of the Research methods course points. These are expressed as 50 points.

--

Answers to **tests** on the methods based on reading material ( $10 \times 2 = 20$ points)

--

A **research report** containing the application of methods learned  ( $10 \times 3 = 30$ points).


???

Theoretical and practical part. Maybe you do something similar in other courses and can combine this somehow? Or combine with your thesis.

---

### Tests on reading material

Demonstrate your understanding of theory.

--

Complete a test during the beginning of each meeting to demonstrate your understanding of the topic and preparedness for discussion.

--

Tests consist of four questions, each contributing half of a point towards the final score.

???

Demonstrate understanding of theory. Tests are to motivate learning, to see if you read and make sure you are prepared for meetings. Feedback for myself on what you do or do not understand.

---

### Research project

Demonstrate your ability to apply the methods in practice.

--

Students are required to create a research report and present the results as follows:

1. Choose a data set
2. Apply at least one method from 10 meetings on this data set
3. Make changes according to feedback if you wish
4. Present the results as a written report

???

Demonstrate practical skills. May have a specific research question, or may not. Can use a different data set for each practical application. As long as it's different from other students.

---

In case of each topic, one point is assigned for each of the following: 

- method is suitable for the data, 
- method is correctly applied, 
- interpretation of the results is correct.

---

# Software

---

## What software can we use for quantitative analysis?

Spreadsheet and statistical software

--

- Spreadsheet - table management (e.g. Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice Calc)
- SPSS - simple GUI-based app with limited functionality
- R - extensible programming language designed for data analysis
- Stata - Mostly CLI-based app, well suited for econometrics
- SAS, Matlab, Statistica, ...

???

You could also use Excel as other students in this institute.

class: middle

![making_progress](../img/making_progress.png)

.footnote[Xkcd. Making progress]

???

Spreadsheets require a lot of repetitive manual work. Plotting is limited.

---

## What are we going to use?

To apply the methods we learn, we will use [Jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/). 

> Jamovi is a new “3rd generation” statistical spreadsheet. designed from the ground up to be easy to use, jamovi is a compelling alternative to costly statistical products such as SPSS and SAS.

> Jamovi is built on top of the R statistical language, giving you access to the best the statistics community has to offer.

---

## You can also use R

R is based on S language originating from 1970's. Developed during 1990's and became public around 2000.

> R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.

> R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, …) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. 

RStudio is a convenient GUI for R.

A wide variety of uses via RMarkdown and Knitr.

???

Programming language similar to any other but developed paricularly for data analysis. Includes many statistical procedures for various fields. Constantly extended by the community with novel methods. Abundant possibilities for plotting data. CLI. The bookdown and presentations are written in R. Demonstrate usage and then ask. 

---

.pull-left[

#### Why a programming language?

- Free and open source
- Powerful and extensible
- Allows for reproducibile analysis
- Active and helpful community
- Used and useful in academia and research

]

.pull-right[

#### Why not?

It's unconventional and has a steep learining curve:

- must feel comfortable with CLI, 
- requires programming skill, 
- data is not constantly visible, 
- no undo.

]

???

Draw a plot to illustrate the learning curve of other software vs R.

# Data management

---

## Data structure

To apply statistical procedures data should be formatted according to the "tidy data" principle:

1. Every column is a variable.
2. Every row is an observation.
3. Every cell is a single value.

--

Data table can be in a long or wide format.

???

Most statistical procedures require 2-dimensional tidy data. 

---

Tidy data (long format): Each row is a  single observation.

``` {r}
Indometh <- Indometh[Indometh$time > 2, ]
head(Indometh)
```

Untidy data (wide format): variable `time` is spread into different columns, so each row is not truly an observation.

``` {r}
wide <- reshape(Indometh, v.names = "conc", idvar = "Subject",
                timevar = "time", direction = "wide")
head(wide)
```

???

Wide and long format. Explain why some procedures don't work when time variable is not in a single column.

---

## Scales of measurement

|  Scale   | Measure property | Operations |       Central tendency        |
| :------: | :--------------: | :--------: | :---------------------------: |
| Nominal  |  Classification  |    =, ≠    |             Mode              |
| Ordinal  |      Level       |    >, <    |            Median             |
| Interval |    Difference    |    +, −    |        Arithmetic mean        |
|  Ratio   |    Magnitude     |    ×, /    | Geometric mean, harmonic mean |

Scales must be kept in mind so that values are treated correctly.

Scales determine the procedures that can be applied to the data. 

???

E.g. when nominal variables are coded as numbers they should not be treated as numeric. Temperature example. Software might print meaningless results if it e.g. treats nominal variables as numeric.

---

#### Binary variables

Can take only two values, usually 0 and 1.

``` {r}
islands <- as.factor(sample(names(islands)[1:4], 10, replace = T))
islands %>% data.frame %>% cbind(model.matrix(~islands + 0))
```

--

The sum and mean of binary variables coded as 0 and 1 are meaningful. What do these show?

---

### Continuous or discrete variables

**A continuous variable** is one in which, for any two values that you can think of, it’s always logically possible to have another value in between.

**A discrete variable** is, in effect, a variable that isn’t continuous. For a discrete variable it’s sometimes the case that there’s nothing in the middle.

---

Discrete variable: the number of a car's gears must be an integer.

``` {r, echo = T}
mtcars$gear
```

Continuous variable: weight of a car may have any positive value (up to a certain point).

``` {r, echo = T}
mtcars$wt
```

---

### Scales in statistical software

The difference between binary, ratio, interval variables is only theoretical. Statistical software treats all numbers as numeric variables.

--

Measure types in Jamovi: nominal, ordinal, continuous (and ID)

Variable types in R: logical, character, factor, integer, float
