# Example data

```{r}
potato <- agridat::johnson.blight
head(potato, 3)
```

- `year`, year
- `area`, area affected, hectares
- `blight`, blight detected, 0/1 numeric
- `rain.am`, number of rainy days in April and May
- `rain.ja`, number of rainy days in July and August
- `precip.m`, precipitation in May when temp > 5C, milimeters

---

# Example problem

Does the number of rainy days in April and May have an effect on blight incidence?

--

Response variable has only 2 values: `0` for no blight and `1` for blight detected.

```{r}
table(potato$blight)
```

We can't expect there to be a linear relationship.

---

Rainy days in April and May plotted against blight.

```{r, echo = F}
plot(blight ~ rain.am, potato, ylim = c(-.1,1.1))
```

---

Linear model `blight ~ rain.am` does not fit the data very well.

```{r, echo = F}
plot(blight ~ rain.am, potato, ylim = c(-.1,1.1))
abline(lm(blight ~ rain.am, potato), col = 'tomato', lwd = 2)
```

---

If we use linear model to model a binary outcome, distribution of errors is not normal.

```{r, echo = F, fig.width = 16}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(lm(blight ~ rain.am, potato), 1)
plot(lm(blight ~ rain.am, potato), 2)
```

---

# The solution: specify error distribution

We can specify a binomial distribution for errors and include a link function such as *logit*. When we do this, we estimate a **logistic regression** model.

```{r, echo = F, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 16}
par(mfrow = c(1,3))
hist(potato$blight, main = "Histogram of observed values")
potBinom <- rbinom(1e3, nrow(potato), mean(potato$blight))
hist(potBinom, freq = F, main = "PDF of binomial distribution")
plot(ecdf(potBinom), main = "CDF of binomial distribution")
```

---

We need to use a generalized linear model to specify an error distribution.

Model can not be simply calculated anymore. 

We need to use maximum likelihood estimation to iterate parameters and find for which parameters is the data most likely.

---

# Logistic regression in R

Binary distribution of errors.

Logistic function to model values of response variable.

$$log(\frac{p}{1 - p}) = \alpha + \beta x + \varepsilon$$

In R: `glm(, family = 'binomial')` (generalized linear model). The default link for binomial distribution is logistic.

---

```{r}
potMod <- glm(blight ~ rain.am, potato, family = 'binomial'); summary(potMod)
```

---

What does the fit look like?

```{r, echo = F}
plot(blight ~ rain.am, potato, xlim = c(0,25), ylim = c(-.1,1.1))
curve(predict(potMod, data.frame(rain.am = x), type = 'response'), 
      from = 0, to = 25, 
      col = 'tomato', lwd = 2, add = T)
```

---

# Interpretation

.pull-left[
```{r}
summary(potMod)
```
]

.pull-right[
The coefficient `r round(potMod$coef[[2]], 3)` is the increase in logged odds of having blight vs not having blight.

When we take exponent of the coefficient we get `r round(exp(potMod$coef[[2]]), 3)` which is the odds of having blight vs not having blight.

There isn't any more intuitive way to interpret this.

We can only say that rainy days in April and May increase the probability of blight.
]

---

# Marginal effects

.pull-left[
```{r}
potModLm <- lm(blight ~ rain.am, potato)
summary(potModLm)
```
]

.pull-right[
When we estimate a binary outcome via linear model, then the coefficient shows the *marginal effect*.

**One average**, one rainy day increases probability of blight by `r round(potModLm$coef[[2]] * 100, 1)` percent.
]

---

*On average* means that it doesn't show the change accurately at every value of `rain.am`.

```{r, echo = F}
plot(blight ~ rain.am, potato, xlim = c(0,25), ylim = c(-.1,1.1))
abline(potModLm, col = 'steelblue', lwd = 2)
curve(predict(potMod, data.frame(rain.am = x), type = 'response'), 
      from = 0, to = 25, 
      col = 'tomato', lwd = 2, add = T)
legend('topleft', legend = c('OLS', 'Logit'), col = c('steelblue', 'tomato'), lty = 'solid')
```

---

# Fitted values

Fitted values represent probability of blight for each observation.

```{r}
potModF <- glm(blight ~ rain.am + rain.ja + precip.m, potato, family = 'binomial')
summary(potModF)
potato$blight.prob <- round(potModF$fitted, 3)
```

---

```{r}
potato
