## A story of drawing inferences

.small[
... a man walked into a Target outside Minneapolis and demanded to see the manager. He was clutching coupons that had been sent to his daughter, and he was angry, according to an employee who participated in the conversation.

“My daughter got this in the mail!” he said. “**She’s still in high school, and you’re sending her coupons for baby clothes and cribs?** Are you trying to encourage her to get pregnant?”

... The manager apologized and then called a few days later to apologize again.

On the phone, though, the father was somewhat abashed. “I had a talk with my daughter,” he said. “It turns out there’s been some activities in my house I haven’t been completely aware of. **She’s due in August. I owe you an apology.**”

# What are we going to do?

---

## What and how?

--

A distinct part of MS.0825 Research methods course. 

--

Flipped classroom

--

Complete tests and submit your research report via course page on Moodle.

--

We meet on Mondays at 13 o'clock and on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 9 o'clock.

---

## Study materials

Detailed information about the course is at [www.lillemets.ee/researchmethods](http://www.lillemets.ee/researchmethods).

Texts for reading are referred in notes and available online.

The notes contain the information presented on the slides more thoroughly.

---

Why not upload slides?

![](../img/presentationhell.png)

## Aims

After completing the course students should be able to:

- understand basic concepts in statistics;  
- know how to describe data, both numerically and visually;   
- choose an appropriate method to solve a problem;  
- use statistical software for data analysis;  
- communicate the results of an analysis (interpret, explain, present);  
- learn about statistical methods individually;   
- find the courage to apply statistical methods.

---

After completing the curriculum successfully, the students:

.smaller[
1. **demonstrate knowledge of contemporary theory and techniques of economics and business administration;**
2. demonstrate in-depth knowledge of agricultural value chains;
3. **utilize scientific research in business administration;**
4. develop an ethical and socially responsible corporate culture through human resource management;
5. evaluate investments and design corporate financial policy;

]

---

## Scoring

Quantitative part gives you 50% of the Research methods course points. These are expressed as 50 points.

--

Answers to tests on the methods based on reading material ( `\(10 \times 2 = 20\)` points)

--

A report containing the application of methods learned  ( `\(10 \times 3 = 30\)` points).

--

These practical applications must be combined into a research project.

???

Theoretical and practical part. Maybe you do something similar in other courses and can combine this somehow? Or combine with your thesis.

---

### Tests on reading material

Complete a test during the beginning of each meeting to demonstrate your understanding of the topic and preparedness for discussion.

--

Tests consist of four questions, each contributing half of a point towards the final score.

???

Demonstrate understanding of theory. Tests are to motivate learning, to see if you read and make sure you are prepared for meetings. Feedback for myself on what you do or do not understand.

---

### Research project

Students are required to create a research report and present the results as follows:

1. Choose a data set
2. Apply at least one method from each meeting on this data set
3. Make changes according to feedback
4. Present the results as a written report

--

In case of each topic, one point is assigned for each of the following: method is suitable for the data, method is correctly applied, interpretation of the results is correct.

???

Demonstrate practical skills. May have a specific research question, or may not. Can use a different data set for each practical application. As long as it's different from other students. 

---

## How would you define statistics?

???

Can mean data or methods

---

# Software

---

## Commonly used software

Spreadsheet and statistical software

--

- Spreadsheet - table management (e.g. Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice Calc)
- SPSS - simple GUI-based app with limited functionality
- R - extensible programming language designed for data analysis
- Stata - Mostly CLI-based app, well suited for econometrics
- SAS, Matlab, Statistica, ...

???

You could also use Excel as other students in this institute.

![making_progress](../img/making_progress.png)

.footnote[Xkcd. Making progress]

???

Spreadsheets require a lot of repetitive manual work. Plotting is limited.

---

## What are we going to use?

To apply the methods we learn, we will use [Jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/). 

&gt; Jamovi is a new “3rd generation” statistical spreadsheet. designed from the ground up to be easy to use, jamovi is a compelling alternative to costly statistical products such as SPSS and SAS.

&gt; Jamovi is built on top of the R statistical language, giving you access to the best the statistics community has to offer.

---

## You can also use R

R is based on S language originating from 1970's. Developed during 1990's and became public around 2000.

&gt; R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.

&gt; R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, …) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. 

RStudio is a convenient GUI for R.

A wide variety of uses via RMarkdown and Knitr.

???

Programming language similar to any other but developed paricularly for data analysis. Includes many statistical procedures for various fields. Constantly extended by the community with novel methods. Abundant possibilities for plotting data. CLI. The bookdown and presentations are written in R. Demonstrate usage and then ask. 

---

.pull-left[

#### Why a programming language?

- Free and open source
- Powerful and extensible
- Allows for reproducibile analysis
- Active and helpful community
- Used and useful in academia and research

]

.pull-right[

#### Why not?

It's unconventional and has a steep learining curve:

- must feel comfortable with CLI, 
- requires programming skill, 
- data is not constantly visible, 
- no undo.

]

???

Draw a plot to illustrate the learning curve of other software vs R.

# Data management

---

## Data structure

To apply statistical procedures data should be formatted according to the "tidy data" principle:

1. Every column is a variable.
2. Every row is an observation.
3. Every cell is a single value.

???

Most statistical procedures require 2-dimensional tidy data. 

---

Untidy data: variable `time` is spread into different columns, so each row is not truly an observation.

???

Wide and long format.

Explain why some procedures don't work when time variable is not in a single column.

---

## Scales of measurement

Scales must be kept in mind so that values are treated correctly.

Scales determine the procedures that can be applied to the data. 

|  Scale   | Measure property | Operations |       Central tendency        |
| :------: | :--------------: | :--------: | :---------------------------: |
| Nominal  |  Classification  |    =, ≠    |             Mode              |
| Ordinal  |      Level       |    &gt;, &lt;    |            Median             |
| Interval |    Difference    |    +, −    |        Arithmetic mean        |
|  Ratio   |    Magnitude     |    ×, /    | Geometric mean, harmonic mean |

???

E.g. when nominal variables are coded as numbers they should not be treated as numeric. Temperature example.

Sofware might print meaningless results if it e.g. treats nominal variables as numeric.

---

#### Binary variables

Can take only two values, usually 0 and 1.

## 1  Antarctica             0                 1           0                0

## 9      Africa             1                 0           0                0
## 10       Asia             0                 0           1                0
```

--

The sum and mean of binary variables coded as 0 and 1 are meaningful. What do these show?

---

### Continuous or discrete variables

**A continuous variable** is one in which, for any two values that you can think of, it’s always logically possible to have another value in between.

**A discrete variable** is, in effect, a variable that isn’t continuous. For a discrete variable it’s sometimes the case that there’s nothing in the middle.

---

### Scales in statistical software

The difference between binary, ratio, interval variables is only theoretical. Statistical software treats all numbers as numeric variables.

--

Measure types in Jamovi: nominal, ordinal, continuous (and ID)

Variable types in R: logical, character, factor, integer, float
