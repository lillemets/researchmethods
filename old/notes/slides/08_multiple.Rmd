## What does a multiple linear regression model look like?

A model with two predictors can be expressed as follows:

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_{1} x_1  + \beta_{2} x_2 + \varepsilon$$

where 

- $\beta_1$ is a coefficient of $x_1$ and
- $\beta_2$ is a coefficient of $x_2$.

---

``` {r}
GrowthDJ <- read.csv('/home/jrl/work/resmeth/data/GrowthDJ.csv', row.names = 1)
GrowthDJ[, sapply(GrowthDJ, is.character)] %<>% `==`('yes')
GrowthDJ <- GrowthDJ[complete.cases(GrowthDJ), ]
```

Let's illustrate it with data on "Determinants of Economic Growth".

.small[
- `oil` factor. Is the country an oil-producing country?
- `inter` factor. Does the country have better quality data?
- `oecd` factor. Is the country a member of the OECD?
- `gdp60` Per capita GDP in 1960.
- `gdp85` Per capita GDP in 1985.
- `gdpgrowth` Average growth rate of per capita GDP from 1960 to 1985 (in percent).
- `popgrowth` Average growth rate of working-age population 1960 to 1985 (in percent).
- `invest` Average ratio of investment (including Government Investment) to GDP from 1960 to 1985 (in percent).
- `school` Average fraction of working-age population enrolled in secondary school from 1960 to 1985 (in percent).
- `literacy60` Fraction of the population over 15 years old that is able to read and write in 1960 (in percent).

Suppose that we wish to know how do population growth and investments influence economic growth.

---

What does the data look like? Here are first rows:

.compact[

``` {r}
head(GrowthDJ, 20) %>% kable
```

]

---

Start with examining (plotting) relationships.

``` {r, fig.height = 5}
par(family = 'RobotoCondensed')
pairs(gdpgrowth ~ ., GrowthDJ[, sapply(GrowthDJ, is.numeric)], 
      gap = .2, cex = .6)
```

???
Can you see something wrong here? An outlier!

---

Suppose we have a reason to exclude the outlier. 

``` {r, fig.height = 5}
par(family = 'RobotoCondensed')
GrowthDJ <- GrowthDJ[GrowthDJ$gdp60 < 2e4, ]
pairs(gdpgrowth ~ ., GrowthDJ[, sapply(GrowthDJ, is.numeric)], 
      gap = .2, cex = .6)
```

---

Our model is thus

$$gdpgrowth = \beta_0 + \beta_{1} popgrowth  + \beta_{2} invest + \varepsilon.$$

``` {r}
Model <- lm(gdpgrowth ~ popgrowth + invest, GrowthDJ)
summary(Model)
```

---

With two predictors, the model is now a plane not a line.

``` {r}
Popgrowth <- seq(floor(min(GrowthDJ$popgrowth)), ceiling(max(GrowthDJ$popgrowth)), 5)
Invest <- seq(floor(min(GrowthDJ$invest)), ceiling(max(GrowthDJ$invest)), 5)
grid <- with(GrowthDJ, expand.grid(popgrowth = Popgrowth, invest = Invest))
vals <- predict(Model, newdata = grid)
Gdpgrowth <- matrix(vals, 
                    nrow = length(Popgrowth), 
                    ncol = length(Invest))
plot_ly(GrowthDJ, x = ~invest, y = ~popgrowth, z = ~gdpgrowth) %>% 
  add_markers(size = .1, showlegend = F, marker = list(color = Col['red'])) %>% 
  add_surface(x = ~Invest, y = ~Popgrowth, z = ~Gdpgrowth, 
              colorscale = 'Greys', opacity = .5, hoverinfo = 'none', 
              contours = list(x = list(highlight = F),
                              y = list(highlight = F),
                              z = list(highlight = F))) %>% 
  hide_colorbar() %>% 
  layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(showspikes = F), 
                      yaxis = list(showspikes = F), 
                      zaxis = list(showspikes = F))) %>% 
  widgetframe::frameWidget(height = 600)
```

??? %>% 
More predictors, more dimensions. If one side is changed, the other also changes: coefficients are often interdependent.

# Why use multiple predictors?

---

### Variables may have mutual influence

.small[
.pull-left[
``` {r}
Model <- lm(gdpgrowth ~ school, GrowthDJ)
summary(Model)
```
]
.pull-right[
``` {r}
Model <- lm(gdpgrowth ~ school + invest, GrowthDJ)
summary(Model)
```
]
]

Studies often include *control variables*.

???
Common control variables used: gender, education, SES

---

Why did secondary school enrolment alone have an effect but not when controlled for investment?

``` {r, fig.height = 4.5}
par(family = 'RobotoCondensed')
pairs(GrowthDJ[, c('gdpgrowth', 'school', 'invest')], 
      labels = c("Economic growth", "Secondary school enrolment",
                 "Investment"))
```

???
Actually, investments have the effect.

---

An effect may only become apparent in combination with other predictors.

.small[
.pull-left[
``` {r}
Model <- lm(gdpgrowth ~ literacy60, GrowthDJ)
summary(Model)
```
]
.pull-right[
``` {r}
Model <- lm(gdpgrowth ~ literacy60 + popgrowth, GrowthDJ)
summary(Model)
```
]
]

???
Coefficients change, too.

---

Why does literacy have no effect alone but does so with population growth?

``` {r, fig.height = 4.5}
par(family = 'RobotoCondensed')
pairs(GrowthDJ[, c('gdpgrowth', 'literacy60', 'popgrowth')], 
      labels = c("Economic growth", "Literacy", "Population growth"))
```

### Simpson's paradox

### Model fit is improved

.small[
.pull-left[
``` {r}
Model <- lm(gdpgrowth ~ popgrowth, GrowthDJ)
summary(Model)
```
]
.pull-right[
``` {r}
Model <- lm(gdpgrowth ~ ., GrowthDJ)
summary(Model)
```
]
]

---

Why do multiple variables better explain variation?

``` {r, fig.height = 5}
par(family = 'RobotoCondensed')
pairs(gdpgrowth ~ ., GrowthDJ[, sapply(GrowthDJ, is.numeric)], 
      gap = .2, cex = .6)
```

# Selection of predictors

---

We can start with adding all other variables as predictors.

``` {r}
Model <- lm(gdpgrowth ~ ., GrowthDJ)
summary(Model)
```

---

## Statistical significance

We could remove statistically insignificant variables.

.small[
.pull-left[
``` {r}
Model <- lm(gdpgrowth ~ ., GrowthDJ)
summary(Model)
```
]
.pull-right[
``` {r}
Model <- update(Model, ~inter + gdp60 + gdp85 + popgrowth + invest)
summary(Model)
```
]
]

---

## F-test

This is a test of overall model fit.

F-statistic is calculated as follows:

$$F = \frac{RSS_1 - RSS_1 / k}{RSS_2/(n-p-1)},$$

where $RSS_1$ is the residual sum of squares of reduced model and $RSS_2$ the same for full model, $k$ the difference in the number of parameters between two models, $p$ the number of parameters and $n$ the number of observations.

$H_0: \beta_1 = \beta_2 = 0$  
$H_1: \beta_1 \neq 0 \text{ or } \beta_2 \neq 0$

Are oil producing and OECD membership together significant predictors of economic growth?

``` {r}
Model <- lm(gdpgrowth ~ oil + oecd, GrowthDJ)
summary(Model)
```

--

> How would you interpret the p-value for F-statistic here?

---

## Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)

It's a measure of model goodness of fit.

For linear regression the information criterion is calculated as follows:

$$AIC = n \times log(\frac{RSS}{n}) + 2 K,$$

where $n$ is the number of observations, $RSS$ the residual sums of squares and $K$ the number of predictors in a model.

**Lower** value indicates better fit.

---

Stepwise backwards selection according to AIC

.scroll[
``` {r}
Model <- lm(gdpgrowth ~ ., GrowthDJ)
step(Model)
```
]

---

## Multicollinearity

It should not be possible to linearly predict any of the predictors from others predictors. Predictors should not be (highly) correlated.

--

Let's look at Pearson's correlation coefficients pairwise.

``` {r}
options(width = 100)
sapply(GrowthDJ, as.numeric) %>% cor %>% round(2)
```

> Can you see anything that could result in collinearity?

???
Otherwise the coefficients are not be reliable.

---

### Variance inflation factor (VIF)

Multicollinearity can be detected with variance inflation factor by using $R^2$ to estimate for each predictor how much of the variation in one predictor can be predicted from others.

$$VIF_{k} = \frac{1}{1 - R^{2}_{k-1}},$$

where $R^{2}_{k-1}$ is $R^{2}$ for a model that has predictor $k$ as a response variable and all other predictors as predictor variables.

Remove predictors that have VIF >5.

---

What about our predictors that were selected using backwards selection with AIC?

``` {r, echo = T}
Model <- lm(gdpgrowth ~ oil + inter + gdp60 + gdp85 + popgrowth + invest, 
            GrowthDJ)
car::vif(Model)
```

> Would you exclude anything?

--

``` {r, echo = T}
Model <- update(Model, ~  oil + inter + gdp60 + popgrowth + invest)
car::vif(Model)
```

---

What happens when we exclude influential predictors?

.small[
.pull-left[
``` {r}
Model <- lm(gdpgrowth ~ oil + inter + gdp60 + gdp85 + popgrowth + invest, 
            GrowthDJ)
summary(Model)
```
]
.pull-right[
``` {r}
Model <- update(Model, ~  oil + inter + gdp60 + popgrowth + invest)
summary(Model)
```
]
]

---

Our final model.

``` {r}
summary(Model)
```

> How to interpret this?

Use the data set `TeachingRatings`.

Investigate the effects on the course overall teaching evaluation score (`eval`).
