This means that students are expected to learn the methods before meetings. During the meetings we revise the theoretical material, address any questions and apply methods in practice. After meetings students apply the methods on their own datasets. 1.2 Schedule Meetings take place on Mondays, Wedensdays and Thursdays at 9 o’clock in the morning. Link to meetings is provided under the course page in Moodle. 1.3 Goals After completing the course students should be able to … … understand basic concepts in statistics. … know how to describe data, both numerically and visually. … choose an appropriate method to solve a problem. … use a statistical package for data analysis. … communicate results (intrepret, explain, present). … find the courage to apply statistical methods. 1.4 Scoring This part of the course gives 50% of total course points. This 50% can be obtained by submitting before each meeting: feedback on reading material for upcoming meeting (10*1=10 points), and application of a method from previous meeting (4*10=40 points). To gain the 40 points students are required to combine the applications of a method into a report and present the results during last meeting. Participation in meetings does not affect points but meetings are not recorded. 1.4.1 Feedback on reading material Submit your questions or thoughts on given reading material before each meeting in Moodle. 1.4.2 Research project Students are required to create a research report and present the results as follows: Choose a data set Apply a method on this data set after each meeting Submit the result before the next meeting via Moodle Make changes according to feedback Present the results as a written report and oral presentation 1.4.2.1 Datasets To apply methods, datasets need to have multiple variables. We mostly learn to explore continuous data but some methods require at least one nominal variable. Students are free to choose a dataset that is different from what other students have chosen. Possible sources for data: Goodle dataset search Kaggle datasets Data hub collections 1.5 Topics We cover some common and traditional statistical methods. Descriptive statistics Inferential statistics. Hypothesis testing. Analysis of variance Contingency tables Correlation Regression. Ordinary Least Squares Regression. Factors and transformations Regression. Maximum likelihood and binary models Principal component analysis Factor analysis. Variamax and oblimin rotations. Clustering. Hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering 1.6 Reading Compulsory reading is from two books: Navarro and Foxcroft (2018) and Crawley (2013).

Sections 2.3-2.7 also provide useful background on validity and reliability of statistical methods. Figure 2.1: Flowchart of statistics 2.2.1 Descriptive and inferential statistics Descriptive statistics Inferential statistics Data on entire population Only a sample of a population Simple measures (e.g. mean) Point estimates and intervals Describing Generalizing 2.2.2 Frequentist and bayesian approach to statistics Frequentist Bayesian Traditional Modern What’s the probability of data given some estimate? What’s the probability of an estimate? Prior is not relevant Estimates are conditional on priors Single parametric inference Multiplication of an inference to get a posterior estimate 2.2.3 Statistics and data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, … Statistics DS, ML, AI, … Less data Big data Clean datasets Untidy data in various formats Traditonal methods Novel methods Mathematics and calculations Programming approach Aim is to explain Aim is to predict 2.3 Software 2.3.1 Commonly used software Spreadsheet vs statistical software Spreadsheet - table management (e.g. Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice Calc) SPSS - simple GUI-based app with limited functionality R - extensible programming language designed for data analysis Stata - Mostly CLI-based, well suited for econometrics 2.3.2 Jamovi To apply the methods we learn, we use Jamovi. Jamovi is a new “3rd generation” statistical spreadsheet. designed from the ground up to be easy to use, jamovi is a compelling alternative to costly statistical products such as SPSS and SAS. Jamovi is built on top of the R statistical language, giving you access to the best the statistics community has to offer. 2.3.3 R language and RStudio This allows us to get under the hood of Jamovi so to speak. R language is based on S language orginating from 1970’s. Developed during 1990’s and became public around 2000. R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, …) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible.
