This means that students are expected to learn the methods before meetings. During the meetings we revise the theoretical material, address any questions and apply methods in practice. After meetings students apply the methods on their own datasets. 1.2 Schedule Meetings take place on Mondays, Wedensdays and Thursdays at 9 o’clock in the morning. Link to meetings is provided under the course page in Moodle. 1.3 Goals After completing the course students should be able to … … know how to describe data, both numerically and visually. … choose an appropriate method to solve a problem. … use a statistical package for data analysis. … communicate results (intrepret, explain, present). … find the courage to apply statistical methods. 1.4 Scoring This part of the course gives 50% of total course points. This 50% can be obtained by submitting before each meeting: feedback on reading material for upcoming meeting (10*1=10 points), and application of a method from previous meeting (4*10=40 points). To gain the 40 points students are required to combine the applications of a method into a report and present the results during last meeting. Participation in meetings does not affect points but meetings are not recorded. 1.4.1 Feedback on reading material Submit your questions or thoughts on given reading material before each meeting in Moodle. 1.4.2 Research project Students are required to create a research report and present the results as follows: Choose a data set Apply a method on this data set after each meeting Submit the result before the next meeting via Moodle Make changes according to feedback Present the results as a written report and oral presentation 1.4.2.1 Datasets To apply methods, datasets need to have multiple variables. We mostly learn to explore continuous data but some methods require at least one nominal variable. Students are free to choose a dataset that is different from what other students have chosen. Possible sources for data: Goodle dataset search Kaggle datasets Data hub collections 1.5 Topics We cover some common and traditional statistical methods. Descriptive statistics Inferential statistics. Hypothesis testing. Analysis of variance Contingency tables Correlation Regression. Ordinary Least Squares Regression. Factors and transformations Regression. Maximum likelihood and binary models Principal component analysis Factor analysis. Variamax and oblimin rotations. Clustering. Hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering 1.6 Reading Compulsory reading is from two books: Navarro and Foxcroft (2018) and Crawley (2013) (See references in Chapter 4).
